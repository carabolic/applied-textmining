Europe Crafts Debt Deal That Pleases Markets

European leaders clinched a deal Thursday they hope will mark a turning point in their two-year debt crisis, agreeing after a night of tense negotiations to have banks take bigger losses on Greece's debts and to boost the region's weapons against the market turmoil.

After months of dawdling and half-baked solutions, the leaders had been under immense pressure to finalize their plan to prevent the crisis from pushing Europe and much of the developed world back into recession and to protect their currency union from unraveling.

World stock markets surged higher Thursday on the news.

Oil prices rose above $92 per barrel while the euro gained strongly — a signal investors were relieved at the outcome of the contentious negotiations.

"We have reached an agreement, which I believe lets us give a credible and ambitious and overall response to the Greek crisis," French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters.

"Because of the complexity of the issues at stake, it took us a full night.

But the results will be a source of huge relief worldwide."

Sarkozy later called his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao and pledged to cooperate to revive global growth, but there was no word on whether Beijing might contribute to Europe's bailout fund.

In this Dec. 10, 2010 file photo, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel talk at a press conference during the German-French consultations in Freiburg, Germany.

The fund's chief executive is due to visit Beijing on Friday to talk to potential investors.

Beijing has expressed sympathy for the 27-nation European Union, its biggest trading partner, but has yet to commit any cash.

The strategy unveiled after 10 hours of negotiations focused on three key points.

These included a significant reduction in Greece's debts, a shoring up of the continent's banks, partially so they could sustain deeper losses on Greek bonds, and a reinforcement of a European bailout fund so it can serve as a euro1 trillion ($1.39 trillion) firewall to prevent larger economies like Italy and Spain from being dragged into the crisis.

After several missed opportunities, hashing out a plan was a success for the 17-nation eurozone, but the strategy's effectiveness will depend on the details, which will have to be finalized in the coming weeks.

The most difficult piece of the puzzle proved to be Greece, whose debts the leaders vowed to bring down to 120 percent of its GDP by 2020.

Under current conditions, they would have ballooned to 180 percent.

To achieve that massive reduction, private creditors like banks will be asked to accept 50 percent losses on the bonds they hold.

The Institute of International Finance, which has been negotiating on behalf of the banks, said it was committed to working out an agreement based on that "haircut," but the challenge now will be to ensure that all private bondholders fall in line.

It said the 50 percent cut equals a contribution of euro100 billion ($139 billion) to a second rescue for Greece, although the eurozone promised to spend some euro30 billion ($42 billion) on guaranteeing the remaining value of the new bonds.

The full program is expected to be finalized by early December and investors are supposed to swap their bonds in January, at which point Greece is likely to become the first euro country ever to be rated at default on its debt.

Nice going Mr. President. Thanks for fixing all the broken wheels.

From Wikipedia;

“Greece’s main industries are tourism, shipping, industrial products, food and tobacco processing, textiles, chemicals, metal products, mining and petroleum.

Greece’s GDP growth has also, as an average, since the early 1990s been higher than the EU average.

However, the Greek economy also faces significant problems, including rapidly rising unemployment levels, an inefficient public sector bureaucracy, tax evasion, corruption and low global competitiveness.” I text searched “Bush”.

Nope, no Bush.

The deal gives Europe a plan to tout at next week’s key Group of 20 meeting in Cannes, France, where countries including China and the United States have been hoping to hear a report of major progress.

The EU bailout of Greece has nothing to do with the US stimulus experiment.

They didn’t fix anything and the financial world is all dumb and happy again??? All they did was put a whole bunch of money aside and basically ok Greece, you don’t have to repay your debt.

And then they put a whole bunch more money aside for other countries to not have to repay there debts if they can’t afford it. This fixes what?

When all this money runs out then where will they be?

All I know is I want to be an economically troubled country in Europe.

It’s like being on welfare in the US.

What a huge relief!

The European debts crisis is over.

Now, everyone can relax and return to making

lots of money on speculation in the markets.

And 2.5% growth in the U.S.

So many good signs for prosperity for all.  Just cannot wait for it all to trickle down.

Gosh, this is such exciting news.

Christmas has arrived two months early.

All is right with the world.

America no longer needs to be concerned about its fiscal/economic domestic issues, because now

the Europeans have finally righted the myriad of economic complexities, that were endangering

our banks and financial systems.

Thank goodness, everything is going to be O.K.

Not.

I thought the same thing that pdion put in his post when I heard this on the news.

Banks are going to eat a 50% loss on bad loans to Greece and yet are ponying up even more money to loan countries in the same situation?

Why is this such a relief to everyone?

After someone with clout sells stocks when they hit highs from this news, someone like Merrill Lynch, which as paid over $165,000,000 in fines even during the G W Bush years for misleading small investors for the benefit of big ones, will start spreading the idea that this deal doesn’t do enough in order to drive stocks back down so the cash from sales can buy more shares.

There really hasn’t been any reason to believe that Greece, whose economy is smaller than the State of Maryland’s, was going to drive the world to ruin or that Europe was going to let itself fall apart due to little Greece.

But the fearmongers have been playing their games.

That’s ok with me:

my reinvested dividends buy more shares on the dips.

Unemployment is stuck at around 9 percent.

Unemployment claims are stuck at around 400,000.

Consumer sentiment is at 2009 levels.

Durable goods orders are flat (manf.

are not replenishing inv.). Most retailers are keeping holiday hiring at 2010 levels which was low. The economy grew but at an anemic 2.5% (we need growth to be sustained at 6% or higher to get out of this malaise).

Business polled across the country have stated they are not planning to hire.

The housing market still hasn’t hit bottom.

So, tell me again how Obama’s policies are getting us out of this economic malaise?

I think it’s a bit premature to break out the champagne just yet. Hence the title that stocks responded to EUROPEAN DEBT DEAL not US recovery.

You can’t change facts, by spending trillions looking for WMD’s, deliberately pushing up the price of Oil, and by deregulating Wall Street Overseers, Bush and the GOP destroyed our economy as well as any stock markets attached to ours.

No, I think Obama’s work with veterans is admirable.

The way he takes credit for just about everything else is political BS. And as a politician he’s a vote scavenger.

Half of what I post is simply not allowing his followers to get away with misattributing or giving him credit for things he has little or nothing to do with.

Bush? His main problem was he didn’t act on problems when the writing was on the wall and was being warned.

Which is just as bad.

The GOP has such pathetic candidates–they are a joke!

They would get no coverage at all except on Fox Right Wing News if the economy were not in the tank because of the ubiqitous housing crisis.

This is the last hurrah for the right wing kooks.

There are about 3 million of them who watch FOX RWN but that’s a drop in the bucket considering the 310 million people in the US.  But…Fox RWN can continue making money off these suckers who are in their own little world.

Why not put the real truth to this deal?

The truth of the deal is that the US tax payers are bailing them out and that all they are doing is buying time with borrowed money.

The reality is that Europeans will destroy a bunch of bondholders who financed the Greek debt.

They will then borrow 1/2 to 3/4 trillion Euros to prevent this from triggering a bankruptcy cascade.

Then 15-35% of this bill will then be sent to the US Treasurey and this loss will be placed on US tax payers.

Too bad we can never get the real truth from mainstream media outlets.

Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the eurozone crisis.

In the early hours of the morning, eurozone leaders emerged from their summit in Brussels with a deal designed to stem the sovereign debt crisis . The markets seem pleased but big questions on the details remain.

We’ll bring you reactions, news and commentary as  we get it throughout the day.

All times are London time. By Tom Burgis on  the news desk in  London, with contributions from FT  correspondents around the world.

18.34:

It’s time to wrap up the live blog for today.

But keep reading FT.com through the evening for:

More news on the eurozone rescue plan and reactions from around the world

Market reports through the US afternoon

Comment pieces coming later from Martin Wolf, Philip Stephens and a special guest

18.13:

Der Spiegel has a nice tale about whether or not Angela Merkel did in fact apologise to Silvio Berlusconi for appearing to smirk when asked publicly if she still had faith in his leadership.

18.07:

Chatham House has just published a paper arguing that international debt bailout systems are ill-equipped to handle any further instability.

“As the problems in the eurozone deepen and threaten to spread globally, action is required to strengthen financial safety nets beyond what was agreed by EU Heads of State on 27 October 2011.”

Read the full report by Stephen Pickford, former managing director at the UK Treasury and former executive director at the IMF.

18.00:

An evening update of the day’s developments:

At the end of trading in Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 finished 3.69 per cent higher for the day at 1,020.

US stocks rose too, with GDP numbers that matched expectations adding to a positive reception for the EU’s moves

Despite the ebullience in equities markets, concerns remained over soveriegn debt in the eurozone.

Italian government bond yields first sank to 5.7 per cent, before rebounding to 5.9 per cent, near their euro-era highs

Questions remain over the details of the eurozone deal, notably over the terms of the new bonds that will replace existing Greek debt as part of the agreed 50 per cent “haircut” (see 13.17), how banks will go about raising new capital and where the cash to fund the various eurozone plans will come from

European officials are keen to involve China and other Bric nations in a fund to buy eurozone debt, though here too there are no firm plans yet

17.28:

Over to Athens, where Kerin Hope, the FT’s Greece correspondent, was at the finance minister’s press conference.

“Evangelos Venizelos has broken a week-long silence on the new Greek haircut much to the relief of Athens businesspeople and bankers.

Flanked at a press conference by exhausted-looking advisers, the finance minister gave a few pointers on the benefits to Greece of Thursday’s deal:

A €8bn slice of Greece’s first bail-out loan will be disbursed by mid-November, just in time to avert a funding crunch that would have delayed payments of wages and salaries at the end of the month, and to enable debt managers to pay back about €2bn of debt maturing at the beginning of December.

A second loan package amounting to €130bn over the next three years will include funds to support the latest fiscal adjustment programme, recapitalise the country’s struggling banks and provide some liquidity for cash-strapped businesses.

€30bn of this amount would be used as security – a “sweetener”  backed by the EFSF in order to encourage participation in the new bond swap that Greece will propose by the end of this year.

Greece will save €4.5-5bn annually on debt servicing costs – about 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product – thanks to a reduction in interest rates on the new funding.”

Kerian adds:

“Mr Venizelos took a robust position on the possibility that several of Greece’s largest banks would be nationalised in the next few months, as they would be forced to seek a capital injection from the bank stability fund set up last year by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.

The interests of the Greek people would take precedence over those of the banks’ owners and shareholders, he said.

He also held out hope that Greeks would be spared further harsh austerity measures next year, provided that the 2012 budget is implemented fully.

Mr Venizelos then rushed off to give a more detailed briefing to the cabinet.”

16.49:

One focus of attention remains the Italian banking system and how it will cope with the higher capital requirements.

Rachel Sanderson in Milan (see 15.01 and 14.19) has comments from the central bank (my emphasis).

“The Bank of Italy said that any recapitalisation programme ‘must be undertaken to avoid excessive deleveraging, with the aim of containing any eventual impact on the Italian economy.

To achieve this objective, the central bank expects banks to limit distribution of dividends and bonuses.’

In a big change to its previous position, the central bank said it would also be possible for banks to use contingent capital (Cocos) if it was in line with EBA guidelines.

There are grave concerns about extra capital calls putting pressure on Italian banks being able to support vital sovereign debt purchases, while they are already facing substantial discounts on the Italian sovereign debt they already hold.”

16.44:

The Greek government is making its first comments of the day.

“We must not lose this chance.

It’s too big,” Evangelos Venizelos, finance minister, told reporters in Athens.

“We will push ahead with all structural reforms.”

16.30:

The star of the show – the euro itself – earlier hit a seven-week high of $1.4149.

Neil Dennis, FT markets reporter, says:

“The euro is currently trading near its highest levels of the day, up nearly 2 per cent at $1.4145 versus the dollar, while European equity markets are being led by France’s impressive 5.3 per cent gain.

The EU deal really seems to eased a lot of nerves and in morning trade on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2.1 per cent, thanks also to a better than expected third-quarter US GDP reading.”

16.19:

Experts at the Council on Foreign Relations, a US think tank, are holding a conference call on the eurozone plan.

Sebastian Mallaby, a CFR international economy specialist, echoes concerns elsewhere about whether the 50 per cent writedown on Greek is “voluntary” or not.

This matters because if it is voluntary, CDS – insurance against a default – are not triggered, which is the outcome Europe’s political leaders favour.

But that would mean that banks holding the bonds would miss out on an insurance payout from the swaps, which would be triggered only if the writedown were involuntary.

Whether one can “volunteer” to take a 50 per cent cut on the value of one’s bonds in the teeth of negotiations with European leaders is perhaps a matter for debate.

In any case, Mr Mallaby reckons that “a voluntary writedown is in some ways more destabilising than an involuntary one”.

As for the much-vaunted plan to raise Chinese funds for a special vehicle to buy eurozone debt (one way in which the eurozone’s bailout fund could be “leveraged” four- or five-fold), Mr Mallaby says:

“I don’t see why China would want to shoulder a bunch of risk in Europe when Germany has the cash and Germany’s refusing to do it.”

To be clear, Germany is chipping in to the bailout funding, but has strictly capped its contribution.

Mr Mallaby reckons any Chinese or other Bric contribution agreed in time for next month’s G20 meeting would be “peanuts”.

15.51:

Amid all this talk of credit default swaps, haircuts and Europeans dashing to Asia to beg for funds, one important group risks being overlooked.

As Jaguar, posting a comment at 3.39pm on this blog below, notes:

“Now we can see what we have been thinking for a long time – that those politicians cannot find a solution because there is no solution there to be found.

Federation is out of the question;

Greece is technically bankrupt;

there is not enough money available to avert disaster.

Little wonder then that so many comments and trips to Asia and elsewhere are suggesting financial support from China, the BRICs together and anyone else with cash to spare!

Meanwhile there is no thought for all those who are presently paying for the total EU debt – us.”

15.48:

Should anyone be thirsting for more details on CDS on Greek debt (see 13.43), the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the body that referees the use of such instruments, has issued an updated Q&A on the Greek debt plan . The thinking so far appears to be that the haircut plan will not trigger a so-called “credit event” in CDS on Greek bonds.

15.21:

The Brics angle to all of this is intriguing:

what role, if any, will wealthy developing countries play in financing Europe’s response to the crisis, in particular the plan to buy distressed sovereign bonds?

What conditions might be attached to such largesse?

Gerrit Wiesmann, FT correspondent in Berlin, reports:

“Only hours after eurozone leaders disbanded, Klaus Regling, the boss of the EFSF, Europe’s bailout fund, boarded an aircraft to Asia in order to bang the drum for the currency bloc’s up-and-coming investment opportunities:

sovereign bonds in part guaranteed by the EFSF, and stakes in a special-purpose investment vehicle which would be dedicated to buying a eurozone country’s bonds.

One German official said Mr Regling had been dispatched to ‘conduct market tests’ in order to assess what mixture of sovereign risk and EFSF-backing investors – private institutions as well as sovereign wealth funds – might be partial to. Mr Regling’s one-man road-show has been circling the globe ever since the EFSF started selling its own bonds at the start of the year.

The auction proceeds have been used to fund assistance packages for Ireland and Portugal, and in future also Greece.

The new sales pitch was said to be complicated because risk-appetite varied from investor to investor, and riskiness from one eurozone sovereign to another.

As a result, eurozone finance ministers would only be able to detail how these new instruments would work in a month’s time.”

15.08:

Some FT video just through, with more reaction to the euro developments.

Richard Milne, capital markets editor, asks  Guillaume Menuet, director of Citi Economics, if investors are likely to  stay satisfied once they have digested the detail of the announcement.

15.01:

Rachel Sanderson in Milan (see 14.19, has the first comments today from the Bank of Italy, Italy’s central bank, delivered by Annamaria Tarantola, deputy director of the Bank of Italy responsible for banking oversight:

“The Italian banking system is solid, it is moving in an efficient direction and it is capable of supporting businesses and families even during the most acute phase of the financial crisis.”

14.47:

Spurred by the eurozone package and healthy US GDP numbers, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has passed 12,000 points .

14.43:

High Frequency Economics, a widely-cited research house not usually known for a bearish or bullish bias, warns funding the euro summit package agreed last night would have a drastic impact on the eurozone economy.

“The programme is in place but the funding is not. Funding all of this will, in our opinion, break the economy and cause a depression the likes of which the Euroland has never seen.

No-one seems to be thinking about this,” writes chief economist Carl Weinberg.

“The un-discussed question is this:

Where is the money going to come from to do all this?

Thus far, the only money has put on the table has been from the banks and other private investors.

They have agreed to accept a 50 per cent hair cut on Greek government bonds.

That money will come from their capital base, which in turn will be supplemented and replaced … with what?

Well in many cases that money will come out of banks’ profits – which means out of the profits of shareholders – and from reducing banks’ balance sheets.

That means less credit for everyone, at least for banks whose assets are loans to the private non-bank sector.

For banks that cannot increase their capital base, the money may come from their governments.

Where will governments, already running deficits without exception, get their money?

They will borrow it, of course, so it will come of the savings of people and businesses – monies that otherwise would have been used for current consumption or investment in the future of the economy.

In other words, it will reduce GDP and that means it will cost the economy jobs and income, opening the door to lower wages and thus lower prices.”

Mr Weinberg adds:

“Seen from the funding side, the euro package will divert €1,300bn worth of savings from private sector investment and spending.

That must mean a reduction of Euroland’s €9400bn GDP by €1300bn, or 13.8 per cent over the period in which it is financed … if, indeed, all the monies can be raised.

In our view, this is a reason to expect a double-digit drop in GDP if this latest scheme is funded over the next year.

That would be an economic depression of historic size with catastrophic consequences.

At minimum, the long-term funding costs of the public sector will soar as this scheme is financed, and not just yields on PIIGS [Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain] bonds but even the yield paid on the mighty Bund.

The increases in bond yields should begin right away.”

14.33:

In Brussels, EU officials and journalists are walking around in a daze following the euro-summmit’s 6am finish on Thursday morning, reports the FT’s Stanley Pignal:

“None look quite as tired as José Manuel Barroso, Commission president, and Herman Van Rompuy, European Council president, who went from the summit straight to the airport to catch a private jet to Strasbourg.

They are there to brief the European parliament, which once a month decamps there from its usual Brussels base.

Van Rompuy told MEPs:

‘Markets will now see our strong determination and will now give us the time needed … This isn’t the end of the crisis, but it may be that we’ve made a start in terms of what we can do as institutions and what we can do collectively.’

Barroso for his part announced a title bump for Olli Rehn, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, who becomes one of eight vice-presidents of the Commission.

“Rehn will also exercise the commission’s responsibilities in the external representation of the Euro area,” the Commission said in a statement.

That should give the Finn an added role in eurozone summits.

However, it stops well short of making him a new “Mr Euro” sitting both in the Commission and in the Council, which represents member states, as some had called for.

After making their own speeches, Barroso and Van Rompuy got to listen to MEPs venting their views on last night’s deal.

“If these decisions had been taken a year ago, we wouldn’t be in this position today,” Martin Schulz, leader of the Socialist bloc in the parliament, castigated them.

The Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists group chairman said it was “like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic”.

14.19 Italian banks are due to comment later on Thursday after the Milan stock market closes about demands from Brussels that the system requires €15bn in additional capital.

Rachel Sanderson reports from Milan:

“Italy’s five largest banks – UniCredit, Intesa Sanpaolo, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Banco Popolare Italiana and UBI Banca – are in close talks with the Italian banking association and the Bank of Italy ahead of making a statement around 1730 Milan time.

Banca Popolare di Milano, Italy’s sixth largest bank by assets, is already due next week to launch a rights issue of €800m, bigger than its market valuation, under pressure from the Bank of Italy.

Still, the mood in Italy was made clear by the head of Italy’s banking association, Giuseppe Mussari, late on Wednesday who said that he had sent a letter to the European Commission and other EU authorities expressing his ‘profound perplexity’ that the Italian banking system should require more capital.

Italian banks are smarting at the edict from Brussels after the system, under pressure from Mario Draghi, the former Bank of Italy governor who is now heading to the European Central Bank, pressed them to raise €10bn of capital in the spring this year.

Sharp falls in their share prices since, rising funding costs and a squeeze on liquidity as a result of the eurozone contagion means many are still looking exposed.

Attention is most closely focused on UniCredit, Italy’s largest bank by assets, which raised €7bn from 2007 to 2009 but was the only large Italian institution to fail to go to the market this spring.

Analysts estimate it requires €5bn-8bn of capital to put it safely within the new EU limits.

Senior bankers familiar with UniCredit say if a market window presents itself, the bank, which operates in 22 countries, may be prepared to undertake a rights issue.

Otherwise, it is expected that Federico Ghizzoni, its chief executive, will present a plan to shrink itself within EU limits by asset disposals and cost cuts in its cost-heavy Italian operations.”

13.17:

Fresh from an all-night session of summitry, Peter Spiegel, FT Brussels bureau chief, has a pressing question:

when is a haircut not a haircut?

“That’s the question many are asking after European leaders reached a headline-grabbing deal early this morning that would have Greek bondholders accept a 50 per cent reduction in the face value of their bonds.

The problem is, without details on how the deal will be worked out, it’s impossible to determine how real that reduction is.

Greek bondholders will take their haircut in a bond swap programme.

It will work something like this:

a private investor trades in his €100 Greek bond for a new €50 Greek bond.

There’s your 50 per cent face value haircut.

But what’s the interest rate on that bond?

And how quickly will it get paid off?

A €50 bond that has – just for argument’s sake – an annual interest rate of 20 per cent (which is near what current Greek bonds are now trading at) wouldn’t be much of haircut at all.

It’s doubtful new bonds will have anywhere near that kind of annual interest rate, which is known as coupon in bond-speak.

In the July bond swap, for example, the new bonds had coupons starting at 4 per cent.

But the key to understanding why the early morning deal is incomplete is to understand how powerful changes in coupons and maturities can be to a value of a bond.

It can drastically change the net present value (NPV) of the new bond you’re getting.

And the dirty little secret about the new deal?

These things haven’t been decided yet.

Peter was among a small group of reporters who met the chief negotiator for Greek bondholders, Institute of International Finance managing director Charles Dallara, before he flew back to Washington this morning:

“Dallara was very clear that the lack of final details on the bond swap and NPV determination gave him quite a bit of room to manoeuvre:

‘The specific elements of the deal – and here’s where you may be a little bit surprised, but this is where we decided to end last night – the specific elements of the deal, that is to say the structure of the new claim on Greece, remains to be negotiated.

So we’re not able to give you definitive numbers that this is the coupon.’

Dallara says his opening offer to European negotiators was a bond swap that would have amounted to about a 46% reduction in net present value, and depending how the swap is structured, Dallara could still theoretically get what he wanted:

‘That is very crucial to us and we feel confident we protected our interest in containing the net present value loss.

We’re not able to put a specific number on it, because that will depend.

We’ve done multiple options of coupons and constructions built around this €30bn package and we feel confident that within the framework of that envelope that we can reach agreement on the particulars that protect the NPV loss.

We didn’t reach agreement on that largely because the heads [Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Nicolas Sarkozy] did not feel it was appropriate for them to deal with this level of detail.

We discussed that particular issue last night directly with Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy.’

So while the deal will certainly cut Greece’s debt levels, it remains impossible to judge just how much of a hit Greek bondholders will really take.

Remember that the highly-touted July 21 deal kept markets happy for a few days until they began to look at the details of what had been agreed.

While last night’s has stronger underpinning than the July deal, we’ll be keeping a close eye on the details.”

13.02:

As traders digest the EU’s plans, Rob Budden, the FT’s deputy markets editor, takes the temperature on the bourses:

A man looks at an electronic board displaying a rise in major market indices around the world, outside a brokerage in Tokyo earlier today

“For the moment at least, markets are giving the thumbs up to the summit’s early morning announcements with a good old-fashioned ‘risk on’ rally.

France’s banks are leading the charge with Credit Agricole up over 20 per cent and the Eurofirst 300 up around 3.3 per cent.

Meanwhile Italian 10-year bond yields have fallen 12 basis points to 5.81 per cent.

Reflecting concerns of the costs of a deal on the core countries, German Bund yields, correspondingly, are up 13bp at 2.16 per cent.”

12.50:

This just in from the British Bankers’ Association welcoming the eurozone agreement:

“We look forward to this bringing about the necessary stability to the system and note that early market sentiment around the world is positive.

Bank recapitalisation has taken place here and so UK banks already meet the new requirements without having to raise further funds.

We believe the eurozone should now focus on a quick implementation of the recovery plan and on building economic recovery.”

And Megan Murphy, the FT’s investment banking correspondent, has pulled together all the banking reaction from across Europe .

12.45:

After the summit, the questions.

Markets are rallying on the eurozone plan but several big posers remain:

Why are the markets so chipper when informed opinion (see 11.11) largely agrees that the summit failed to deliver any resembling a comprehensive solution to Europe’s economic woes?

Will China ride to the rescue?

US markets closed up yesterday before there was anything concrete from Brussels, seemingly on the belief that Beijing would chip in to a fund to buy struggling eurozone debt.

Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s president is due to chew this over with Hu Jintao, his Chinese counterpart, today

What news of CDS?

There was much talk ahead of the summit about the risk of a cut in the value of Greek bonds triggering a “credit event” , potentially causing further unease about banks’ finances

How much capital do the banks really have to raise?

Banking stocks have rallied today but there are questions about exactly what kind of assets will qualify for the newly raised capital buffers – and queries about Italian lenders, given their exposure to national debt

And beyond all this, whither Europe?

Many, including former UK prime minister Sir John Major on the op-ed page of today’s FT , see a clear road ahead towards fiscal union to complement monetary union.

Are we heading for a two-track Europe, with the 17 members of the single currency knit tightly in the centre and the other 10 EU members banished to the periphery of decision-making?

What would that mean for Croatia, Turkey and other aspirant future members?

Are you an investor, a trader, a voter, a protester?

Do you run a European country?

We are very keen to hear your views on all these developments in the comments section at the bottom of this blog.

12.17:

Aside from the markets, there is of course an intricate political dimension to the the eurozone plan – and how it will play out within the domestic politics of member countries.

For the first time in a long while, Silvio Berlusconi, under extreme pressure in the run-up to the summit, appears to have Italy’s opposition parties on the back foot, reports Guy Dinmore, the FT’s correspondent in Rome:

“The eurozone summit cautiously welcomed the Italian prime minister’s commitments to a package of measures aimed at cutting state spending, raising money by selling assets and promoting growth.

Italy’s opposition leaders had been banking on a rejection of what they expected to be a mealy-mouthed list of vague promises with no firm timetable.

They were disappointed.

This has put them in a tricky position — do they try to block the reforms and look churlish in the eyes of many Italians who are losing faith with the entire ruling elite?

From initial statements they appear to be betting that differences within Mr Berlusconi’s own fractured coalition will sink the proposed reforms even without opposition intervention, thus paving the way for new elections, perhaps next spring.

Given reports about the desperate state of relations between the prime minister and Giulio Tremonti, finance minister, as well as tensions with the Northern League coalition partners, opposition hopes of an internal government collapse may yet be realised.

Meanwhile reaction from the trades unions — much less powerful these days — was more predictable, with leaders issuing a call to arms to resist forced redundancies in the public and private sector, while complaining they were never consulted.

Mr Berlusconi knows he has to deliver.

He will not escape the scrutiny of Brussels and that of Mario Draghi, who is off to Frankfurt to run the ECB from next Tuesday.

Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, has given Mr Berlusconi his orders.

‘The key is implementation.

It is not enough to make commitments, it is necessary now to check if they are really implementing,’ Mr Barroso warned last night.”

11.52:

The Institute of International Finance, which represented banks that hold Greek bonds in the haircut negotiations with European governments, has put out a statement.

Josef Ackermann , chief executive of Deutsche Bank and IIF chairman, says:

“We are very pleased with the agreement reached.

It was appropriate for all parties to move on the July 21 decisions in light of the changed circumstances.

The Greek economy has weakened considerably since that time and the different parties are taking additional difficult measures to lay the basis for stabilization and renewed growth.

European leaders are also doing more, and as all parties have recognized that not only the future of Greece but the future of Europe was at stake.

The outcome is a good one for Greece, Europe and the investors, and we look forward to its early implementation.”

Charles Dallara, IIF Managing Director, adds:

“This voluntary substantial reduction in Greek debt by the private sector, along with additional official support, provides an historical opportunity for Greece to revitalize its economy and reap the benefits of the difficult measures the Greek people have undertaken.

We look forward to work with the Greek and European authorities to translate this framework into a concrete agreement that can deliver an early reduction in Greece’s debt and place it squarely on a path toward debt sustainability.

Throughout the process we have enjoyed strong support from the IIF’s Board of Directors and from many leaders of other financial institutions.”

11.11:

We’ll have a round-up of all the latest developments from the morning shortly, but for now two FT comment pieces offer trenchant interpretations of the eurozone plan.

Wolfgang Münchau writes on the FT’s A-List :

The day may yet come when the eurozone finally agrees a comprehensive package to end the crisis, but this was not the day. What policymakers agreed at 4am Brussels time on Thursday came close to what they set out to do.  They secured a “voluntary” deal with the banks, and they agreed the  outer perimeters of a system to leverage the European financial  stability facility.

But none of this is going to end the crisis.

Read the full piece

And Gavyn Davies opines:

In typical European fashion, a summit deal which seemed out of reach at midnight last night was triumphantly unveiled at 4am. The deal does not, and was not intended to, have any effect on the core problems facing the eurozone.

There is still an urgent need to restore growth to economies which are hamstrung by uncompetitive business sectors, and continuous fiscal tightening.

Recession still looms, especially in the southern economies.

Phew!

Emerging from euro fog

Oct 27, 2011 06:57 EDT

banks | central banks | china | corporate earnings | ecb | euro zone | European Union | funds | germany | Global Investing | investment | investors | markets | U.S. economy

Holding your breath for instant and comprehensive European Union policies solutions has never been terribly wise.  And, as the past three months of summit-ology around the euro sovereign debt crisis attests, you’d be just a little blue in the face waiting for the ‘big bazooka’.

And, no doubt, there will still be elements of this latest plan knocking around a year or more from now. Yet, the history of euro decision making also shows that Europe tends to deliver some sort of solution eventually and it typically has the firepower if not the automatic will to prevent systemic collapse.

And here’s where most global investors stand following the “framework” euro stabilisation agreement reached late on Wednesday.

It had the basic ingredients, even if the precise recipe still needs to be nailed down.

The headline, box-ticking numbers — a 50% Greek debt writedown, agreement to leverage the euro rescue fund to more than a trillion euros and provisions for bank recapitalisation of more than 100 billion euros — were broadly what was called for, if not the “shock and awe” some demanded.  Financial markets, who had fretted about the “tail risk” of a dysfunctional euro zone meltdown by yearend, have breathed a sigh of relief and equity and risk markets rose on Thursday.

European bank stocks gained almost 6%, world equity indices and euro climbed to their highest in almost two months in an audible “Phew!”.

Credit Suisse economists gave a qualified but positive spin to the deal in a note to clients this morning:

It would be clearly premature to declare the euro crisis as fully resolved.

Nevertheless, it is our impression that EU leaders have made significant progress on all fronts.

This suggests that the rebound in risk assets that has been underway in recent days may well continue for some time.

So what exactly have investors and been doing while waiting for the fog to clear in Brussels?  The truth on most benchmark prices and indices is “not very much” — at least not since world markets got the collywobbles in early August about US downgrades and debt ceilings, euro sovereign debt angst and double dip recession.

Yet, since the European stocks nadir in late September prodded the Franco-German alliance into more serious action, there has been some impressive market gains of between 10 and 20% across most equity sectors and national indices.

More broadly, after a year of intense political and financial turmoil across the globe, developed market equities are only down about 4% year-to-date — a 10 point outperformance on emerging markets, for example.

And the clearing of the euro fog now allows investors to start looking beyond the Brussels cauldron and review how the rest of the world is shaping up. What they find, surprisingly for those drowning in disaster commentaries, is‘not all that bad – especially, but not exclusively in the United States.

There’s been a string of more positive economic data releases throughout October and these have continued through the back end of last week and early this week.

The bellwether Philadelphia Fed industrial index rose to its highest in six months;

U.S. durable goods orders (excluding volatile aircraft orders) rose at their fastest pace in six months in September;

U.S. new home sales rose at their fastest in five months;

business surveys show Chinese manufacturing is back expanding again in October for the first time in three months;

U.S. power firms are reporting a pickup in industrial activity in H2, Ford has increased fourth quarter forecast for North American vehicle production.

The U.S. Q3 earnings season hasn’t been half bad either – with a third of the S&P500 reported, some 70 percent beat forecasts and the main strength was in the industrial world.

What’s more for markets, seasonal equity flows are typically in an updraft for the rest of the year, all things being equal.

Fund managers already started rebuilding equity positions in September .

European business and consumer sentiment surveys have continued to push lower through the policy logjam, unsurprisingly, even if real data contradicts some of that anecdotal ‘evidence’.

And this may well translate into the wider investment theme as the euro crisis ebbs.

Europe may agree to adapt grudgingly to solve its immediate problem but tyhen pay the price in economic growth because it’s less worse than the alternative of financial chaos.

On the more immediate horizon, there may be groans  from those hoping to escape summit mania as G20 leaders are set to meet in Cannes next Thursday and Friday — with a hoped-for endorsement of the euro plan and a specific interest in the EFSF/IMF/SPV idea that seems to be courting sovereign wealth funds from China and other emerging giants from the BRICs to use a special conduit to buy euro sovereign bonds.

ECB rate cuts too may be firmly back in the frame on Thursday as Mario Draghi takes the helm of the central bank for the first time.

The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee gives us its latest decision on Wednesday.

US payrolls looms large on Friday, with a heavy European earnings sked including Barclays, BMW, ING, BNPP, Unilever, CS, ArcelorMittal, RBS, Commerzbank, and many more.

Comment on this Comment on this article

Angela Merkel glowers at the Bundestag today (Photo:

Reuters)

Alone among EU leaders, Chancellor Angela Merkel goes to tonightâ€™s summit in Brussels with an iron-clad mandate.

It is a remarkable moment.

Never before – to my knowledge – has a national parliament demanded and held a prior vote on an EU summit accord.

Had this principle been established a long time ago, we might have avoided much of the relentless Treaty creep and EU aggrandizement advanced by secret deals at the BÃ¢timent Justus Lipsius.

Thank you Germany.

Thank you too, judges of the Verfassungsgericht, for giving the Bundestag a veto on EU encroachments on fiscal sovereignty.

The court is seemingly the only tribunal willing and able to defend the liberties of European citizens against EU over-reach, and is therefore my supreme court too even as a British citizen.

Dr Merkel has won her vote.

She secured an "own majority" for proposals to leverage the â‚¬440bn bail-out fund (EFSF) into the stratosphere, with the support of some very sheepish looking law-makers from posturing Free Democrats and Bavariaâ€™s Social Christians.

But what a price she paid.

The credibility of her team is shattered.

Europe has all but destroyed her, even if she manages to limp on to the next crisis.

As she glowered darkly, speaker after speaker from the Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens, and Die Linke, asked how she could possibly reconcile her plan to leverage the EFSF to â‚¬1 trillion or â‚¬1.5 trillion (we still donâ€™t know how much) with solemn pledges to the Bundestag just three weeks ago that there would be no such leverage.

"Shameless abuse of the truth," was the verdict of SPD leader Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

The government had acted "tactically" at every turn, "misled the people", "held back information", "crossed every red line", brought Europe "to its knees" with botched policies, and lied blatantly about EFSF leverage.

"You came here to say there would be no leverage, not three years ago, not three months ago, but three weeks ago. You denied everything."

"This is a matter of democracy in our country.

Trust is the resource with which we all work."

(For those German speakers who watched the debate, excuse my instant and loose translation, but I think it is not far off.)

Die Linke (Left) leader Gregor Gysi was electrifying.

"It is the arrogance of power," he began, and never let go.

"Every week you come up with a different story about this crisis."

"We were told there would be no leverage and you have reversed everything in a matter of weeks.

Now we learn that the 20pc loss will fall entirely on taxpayers.

They alone will pay. That is the decision you are taking."

"Why donâ€™t you tell German taxpayers the truth?

They are being asked to pay the lossesÂ for French banks."

Green leader JÃ¼rgen Trittin rebuked Dr Merkel for hiding the true implications of EFSF leverage, particularly the plan to insure the first 20pc of losses on Club Med bonds.

"Why are you shying away from telling the people the truth?

You must tell people what this leverage means.

You must explain to them what the risk is, and why it is necessary.

But you wriggled out of it."

"You came here three weeks ago and said there would be no leverage.

This is the sort of thing that unnerves people."

And so it went on, raw red-blooded democracy.

The unpleasant truth is that the EFSF leverage proposals are idiotic, the worst sort of financial engineering, legerdemain, and trickery.

As countless economists have pointed out, it concentrates risk.

Germanyâ€™s â‚¬211bn commitment to the fund is not technically breached but the risk of suffering large and perhaps total loss is vastly increased.

Creditor states switch from protected senior status on Greek, Portuguese, or Italian debt to the bottom rung on new slabs of sub-prime structured credit.

The bluff might well be called.

The consequence will be to bring forward the downgrade of France and other states.

It will accelerate contagion to the core, not stop it.

Why is Germany pushing for such a destructive policy?

Because it dares not cross the â‚¬211bn red-line that has become totemic in the Bundestag, and because it has for ideological and cultural reasons excluded the one option that can plausibly halt the eurozone crisis – which is mobilizing the full fire-power of the European Central Bank.

It should be obvious by now that euroland needs an authentic lender-of-last-resort.

Yes, there is a risk that ECB bond purchases could degenerate into chronic monetisation of deficits.

But it is an even greater risk that the EFSF – as proposed – will set off a calamitous chain of events.

Personally, I felt almost swept along by Chancellor Merkel as she pleaded for support to help put Greece "back on its feet again", etc, etc, and warned with pathos that another fifty years of peace in Europe cannot be taken for granted.

But as soon as you think about it, such a claim to idealism is make-believe.

Her own government is the architect and enforcer of one-sided austerity policies – without offsetting monetary and exchange stimulus, or demand growth in the North – that are pushing Southern Europe into debt deflation and a downward economic spiral.

It is her own call for bondholder haircuts in Greece that set off contagion from Greece, first to Ireland and Portugal, and then to Italy and Spain.

It is her refusal to contemplate a change in the mandate of the ECB – by treaty if necessary – that is now exacerbating the crisis.

Far from preserving the peace of Europe for another fifty years, her policies are more likely to bring about the very mischief and grief she warns against.

So let us take her Rhetorik with a pinch of salt.

Still, a splendid day for German democracy.

European Leaders Reach “Broad Agreement” On Finances

Posted Wednesday, October 26th, 2011 at 10:00 pm

European Union diplomats say private bankers lending money to Greece have reached an agreement to take a 50 percent loss on the debt.

A formal announcement is expected Thursday.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and IMF chief Christine Lagarde met with the banking lobby late Wednesday in Brussels to press the issue.

Private banks earlier agreed to write off about 20 percent of the Greek debt, but they balked at taking a bigger loss.

EU leaders sought to persuade private banks to take a 60 percent loss on the debt.

Earlier Wednesday, eurozone leaders agreed that European banks would have to raise close to $150 billion to recapitalize.

They also plan to increase their bailout fund to $1.4 trillion, but details on how that will be done will not be finalized until next month.

The European heads of state are attempting to resolve a two-year-long debt crisis that in recent weeks has roiled international financial markets fearful of a Greek default on its obligations, and the spread of the debt contagion to bigger European economies in Italy and Spain.

Ms. Merkel told the German parliament earlier Wednesday that it is Europe's “most serious crisis since the end of World War II.”

At her urging, the German lawmakers approved a sharp increase in the continent's bailout fund to assist debt-ridden countries.

The parliament voted overwhelmingly to more than double the size of the fund to about $1.4 trillion.

That gave Ms. Merkel new clout as she headed to the late-day summit in the Belgian capital.

While the immediate focus has been on debt-ridden Greece, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy pressed Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to move faster to adopt new economic reforms to stave off the need for an Italian bailout.

European Leaders Reach “Broad Agreement” On Finances

Posted Wednesday, October 26th, 2011 at 7:25 pm

European Union officials say they have reached a “broad agreement” on a plan to boost bank capital, but they failed to agree with private sector on how much of the Greek debt needs to be forgiven.

Under the plan hammered Wednesday in Brussels, European banks would have to raise close to $150 billion to recapitalize.

Eurozone leaders also plan to increase their bailout fund to $1.4 trillion, but details on how it will be done will not be finalized until next month.

But EU leaders failed to persuade private banks lending money to Greece to take a 60 percent loss on the debt.

Charles Dallara, director of the Institute of International Finance, which represents banks and private sector investors, said they are open to dialogue in search of a voluntary agreement to any deal.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and IMF chief Christine Lagarde met with banking officials late Wednesday to discuss the issue.

The European heads of state are attempting to resolve a two-year-long debt crisis that in recent weeks has roiled international financial markets fearful of a Greek default on its obligations and the spread of the debt contagion to bigger European economies in Italy and Spain.

Ms. Merkel told German parliament earlier Wednesday that it is Europe's “most serious crisis since the end of World War Two.”

At her urging, the German lawmakers approved a sharp increase in the continent's bailout fund to assist debt-ridden countries.

The parliament voted overwhelmingly to more than double the size of the fund to about $1.4 trillion.

That gave Mrs. Merkel new clout as she headed to the late-day summit in the Belgian capital.

She called on banks holding Greek debt to forgive 50 percent of the amount the Athens government owes so that it can regain its economic footing over the coming decade.

But agreement on terms of the debt-relief plan has proved elusive, leaving some analysts to question whether the heads of state will be able to keep their pledge to complete the plan on Wednesday.

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou called the impending decisions “a critical time,” requiring European leaders to “remain clear-headed and calm.”

The financial institutions agreed last July to write off  21 percent of the Greek debt they hold and have offered to raise that to 40 percent.

But negotiations over terms of a deal appeared stalemated.

While the immediate focus has been on debt-ridden Greece, Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy pressed Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to move faster to adopt new economic reforms to stave off the need for an Italian bailout.

Markets, Leader React Positively to Eurozone Debt Plan

Posted Thursday, October 27th, 2011 at 4:50 am

European Union leaders announced a plan Thursday to significantly reduce Greece's debt burden and bolster the eurozone bailout fund as part of a comprehensive effort to contain the eurozone debt crisis.

Following 10 hours of tense negotiations in Brussels, EU leaders said they convinced private sector investors to accept a 50 percent loss on Greek government bonds, effectively reducing Greek debt by $140 billion.

The deal would lower Greece's debt burden to 120 percent of its GDP by 2020, down from 160 percent now.

In order to sustain losses on Greek bonds, major European banks would be required to raise an additional $148 billion by June.

EU leaders also agreed to increase the firepower of the depleted eurozone bailout fund, boosting its resources to $1.4 trillion.

European markets reacted positively, with the euro surging upon announcement of the plan.

Markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt all soared in early trading.

French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said the deal has effectively saved the European single currency, telling French radio that it will “stabilize the eurozone and global growth.” World Bank cheif Robert Zoellick welcomed the deal, as did officials in China and Japan.

The full package is expected to be finalized and approved by the end of the year.

European heads of state and central bankers are attempting to resolve a two-year-long debt crisis that in recent weeks has roiled international financial markets fearful of a Greek default on its obligations, and the spread of the debt contagion to bigger European economies in Italy and Spain.

World Markets Soar in Reaction to Eurozone Debt Plan

Posted Thursday, October 27th, 2011 at 5:00 pm

World financial markets soared Thursday after the European Union approved a plan to cut Greece's debt in half and significantly increase a bailout fund designed to contain the eurozone debt crisis.

The Paris stock exchange jumped more than 6 percent, with the Frankfurt market advancing more than 5 percent.

The London exchange closed up nearly 3 percent, and U.S. indexes were all ahead by about 3 percent at the close of the trading day.

European leaders generally expressed optimism regarding the results of their summit in Brussels, saying the threat to the stability of the eurozone has been contained.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the plan was an ambitious and credible response to the crisis.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the deal an overall good package for the next stage, but warned there were more stages to go.

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said the 50 percent write-off makes the Greek debt sustainable.

U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed Europe's new debt plan and said it is crucial that it be implemented fully and decisively.

Mr. Obama said he has confidence in the European leadership and that the deal will definitely have an impact on the United States.

Mr. Obama spoke at the beginning of an Oval Office meeting with Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas.

In a statement earlier Thursday, the U.S. president called the agreement a “critical foundation” to help solve the eurozone crisis and said the United States will support its European allies to address global economic problems.

Following 10 hours of tense negotiations in Brussels, EU leaders said they had convinced banks and investors to accept a 50 percent loss on Greek government bonds, effectively reducing Greek debt by $140 billion.

At the same time, the banks are required to raise an additional $148 billion by June.

The 17-nation bloc that uses the euro currency is increasing the firepower of its bailout fund to $1.4 trillion to cover future assistance for debt-ridden nations.

The deal still leaves Greece with a significant debt burden — estimated at 120 percent of its economic output in 2020, down from 160 percent now.  But Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said that debt level “becomes viable” for the country.

Financial analysts and world leaders outside Europe have said in the past that the continent's leaders were too timid in dealing with the crisis.

International creditors have approved single bailouts for Ireland and Portugal and two for Greece.

Those bailouts failed to calm the fears of financial markets that Greece would eventually default on its obligations, and that the debt contagion would spread to bigger European economies in Italy and Spain.

Analysts said Thursday the Brussels agreement could give the continent's weaker economies more time to grow and adapt to the austerity measures their governments have imposed.

A cheat sheet of market reactions to the European Union deal on Greek debt and bank recapitalization revealed overnight.

CITIGROUP:

Enthusiasm for the deal has been surprising, considering the lack of new detail.

While the deal represents a step in the right direction, it is doubtful that this package can bring long-term support for the euro.

“We don’t think this package can sustain major gains unless outside money is more enthusiastic about backing euro-zone debt than either the [European Central Bank] or euro-zone governments seem to be, and we are not sure why this should be the case,” the bank added.

DEUTSCHE BANK:

The deal is a step in the right direction, but hurdles still lie ahead.

“The final outcome crucially depends on the capacity to attract potential non-European investors, and a full finalization of the deal with the private sector on Greek debt with an acceptable level of participation,” the bank notes, adding that French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s chat with Chinese Premier Hu Jintao this week, followed by developments at the G-20 meeting Nov. 3-4, will be key.

SOCIETE GENERALE:

The long-term verdict on the deal will come from the bond markets, rather than the currencies space.

It is premature to talk about containing the crisis when Italian 10-year yields were still dangerously close to the 6% mark and the positive initial reaction in currencies is probably the result of very low expectations.

UBS:

Doubts the euro can hold on to gains.

The most important development to come out from the deal was the agreement about the 50% “voluntary” haircut that banks would take on their Greek debt.

“This means that in all likelihood [the International Swaps and Derivatives Association] will rule that the restructuring does not amount to a credit event and [credit default swap] payout is not triggered,” Chris Walker, a currency strategist at the bank, said.

BARCLAYS CAPITAL:

The package is more a bandage on the wound than a treatment of the underlying symptoms.

The bank was also skeptical about how difficult it will be to agree on the practical details of the deal.

“Politics is a fractious business even on a week-to-week basis and, at best, the resolution of the problems will take years,” the bank said.

It is also concerned about extremely weak growth in the euro zone, and concluded that buying dollars and the Japanese yen looks more appealing than betting on the euro.

COMMERZBANK:

Key issues remain unresolved and the agreement won’t mark a turning point in the crisis.

“The crucial question is ‘will investors buy into this scheme’,” the bank said.

It thinks not. Investors might not perceive the leveraged-up European Financial Stability Facility as sufficient, while partial government insurance against sovereign defaults officially embraces the notion that such an event is possible.

Therefore, the perceived probability of a sovereign default is higher.

STEPHEN JEN, SLJ MACRO PARTNERS:

“They have segmented the problems and dealt separately with the debt and the banks, and this helps to manage contagion.

There are three main risks.

The first is that the haircut is supposed to be voluntary, but it has been agreed with banks, not with asset managers and other investors who hold a lot of these bonds.

I find it hard to believe there won’t be any holdouts, so there’s a risk of a disorderly default.

“The second is that leveraging up the EFSF could jeopardize France’s triple-A rating.

And the third is that the bank recapitalization could mean banks recall loans and cut their balance sheets sharply, threatening economic growth.”

BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON:

“There is clearly some immediate scope for some mood-souring as commentators step forward to interrupt the political back-slapping to pick holes in the plans.

However, the fact that the euro is afloat and back on course may be all that matters for the time being.

All evidence from the past 18 months has suggested that, whilst the euro zone’s battered infrastructure has been deemed to be intact, its shortcomings have failed to transpose directly onto the single currency’s performance.”

SCHRODERS:

“These are very positive steps in the right direction, which reinforces our view that European politicians are willing to take unprecedented action to keep the European Monetary Union together.

There are a lot of details still missing from the plan, though we are encouraged that European politicians are moving in the right direction.

The deal should help reduce the volatility in financial markets, though the damage may have already been done to the real economy.”

By Terence Roth

Digesting the outcome of the marathon overnight euro-zone summit boils down to four central points:

1.) Short on detail, but euro-zone leaders might have come up with less, which could have been a catastrophe for European markets.

Agreeing to a 50% writedown on banks’ Greek government bond holdings already last night wasn’t always expected.

2.) Ironing out the prickly details with banks, regulators, governments and parliaments will treat financial markets to weeks, if not months, of more uncertainty.

3.) Despite an 11th-hour letter promising reforms, Italy and its disorderly political landscape has emerged as the next European Union ‘management problem.’

4.) The Summit’s emergency-response pact is entirely defensive in nature, throwing up more bulwarks against fiscal rot and bank runs without creating a growth component.

Hurdles remain, including tough negotiations with banks, who have sought politically problematic guarantees when ‘voluntarily’ participating in Greek debt relief plan.

Another issue is avoiding the implied 50% writedown on their Greek debt amounting to a Greek default, which could devastate the bond markets of weaker euro-zone countries.

Financial markets will open Thursday jubilant that the leaders of the 17 euro-sharing countries laid the foundation for guarding against the debt crisis spreading from Greece to Italy and Spain, a threat that could have scuttled the euro and trigger a global financial crisis.

Will it work?

What’s missing is a focus on filling fiscal gaps by getting Europeans back to work.

Europe’s second big threat is a new recession that could undo the last night’s progress.

Nary a word on growth and investment needed as a proactive cure to fiscal deficits, lower welfare costs and higher tax intake.

Instead, the mantra being handed down from the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund is more spending cuts and revenue creation.

Greece, at the core of the crisis, is facing a fifth year of recession in 2012 with a growing risk of civil disorder as still more austerity measures bite.

Spain and Italy could soon show contracting economies.

Deutsche Bank now believes that even the German economy could slip into a shallow recession for the next two quarters.

Some elements of the pact sketched at the summit can act as growth retardants.

One example is the plan to recapitalize Europe’s 70 biggest banks by EUR106 billion, to meet a higher capital requirement.

Details on the source of this new capital aren’t finalized.

But the process risks, at best, curbing lending activity, and at worst, will require input from already impoverished governments.

Taxpayers also risk exposure down the road from plans to leverage a new bailout fund and insurance demanded by banks for Greek debt relief.

Markets surge after eurozone summit deal

BRUSSELS, Belgium - Europe's ground-breaking deal to save its single currency sent markets soaring and bolstered the euro Thursday as analysts queried whether the masterplan to put paid to the debt crisis would stand the test of time.

After an unprecedented marathon of talks, involving two EU and two eurozone summits in just four days, Europe's leaders in the small hours Thursday agreed a new rescue of Greece, a trillion-euro (S$1.75 trillion) bailout fund, and cut a deal squeezing banks to share the burden of the two-year debt crisis.

"We have done what needed doing," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

News of the deal sent markets surging, with stocks in Paris and Milan up five per cent in mid-afternoon trade and the euro hitting a seven-week high against the dollar.

"Decisions have been made in Europe, and even if we are short on detail Europe's leaders are talking the right game and the markets seem to like it," said Kathleen Brooks, an analyst at traders Forex.com.

With the deal reached, IMF chief Christine Lagarde welcomed "substantial progress", but European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet warned that "all of this now requires a lot of work and a lot of quick work."

Analysts likewise welcomed the deal by European Union leaders, repeatedly accused of doing too little too late in the face of a festering two-year crisis, that after claiming Greece, Ireland and Portugal threatens Europe's third and fourth economies, Italy and Spain.

EU institions and governments "now seem more determined to get ahead of the crisis curve," said Janis Emmanouilidis of the European Policy Centre.

"But it is by no means clear whether the final package will be able to boost confidence and provide orientation in the weeks and months to come."

Russia said the deal was grounds for "cautious optimism" to hold off dangers on the global front while China pledged faith in the eurozone and confirmed that President Hu Jintao would speak to French counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy later Thursday.

And Beijing, like Moscow, reiterated it would likely take a stake in the European rescue fund through the IMF, a sign that emerging economies plan to to play a larger role in the world economy.

Deal struck to contain eurozone debt crisis

Banks to absorb 50% losses on Greek bonds

BRUSSELS—Eurozone leaders struck a deal with private banks and insurers on Thursday for them to accept a 50-percent loss on their Greek government bonds under a plan to lower Greece’s debt burden and contain the two-year-old eurozone crisis.

The agreement was reached after more than eight hours of hard-nosed negotiations involving bankers, heads of state, central bankers and the International Monetary Fund.

It aims to draw a line under spiraling debt problems that have threatened to unravel the European single currency project.

Under the deal, the private sector agreed to voluntarily accept a nominal 50-percent cut in its bond investments to reduce Greece’s debt burden by 100 billion euros, cutting its debt to 120 percent of GDP by 2020, from 160 percent now.

At the same time, the eurozone will offer “credit enhancements” or sweeteners to the private sector totaling 30 billion euros.

The aim is to complete negotiations on the package by the end of the year, so Greece has a full, second financial aid program in place before 2012.

The value of that package, EU sources said, would be 130 billion euros—up from 109 billion euros when a deal was last struck in July, an agreement that subsequently unraveled.

“The summit allowed us to adopt the components of a global response, of an ambitious response, of a credible response to the crisis that is sweeping across the eurozone,” French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters afterwards.

As well as the deal on deeper private sector participation in Greece—which emerged after Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel engaged in negotiations with bankers—eurozone leaders also agreed to scale up the European Financial Stability Facility, their 440 billion euro ($600 billion) bailout fund set up last year.

The fund has already been used to provide help to Ireland, Portugal and Greece, leaving around 290 billion euros available.

Around 250 billion of that will be leveraged 4-5 times, producing a headline figure of around 1.0 trillion euros, which will be deployed in a variety of ways.

Leaders hope that will be enough to stave off any worsening of the debt problems in Italy and Spain, the region’s third and fourth largest economies respectively.

Riskier assets across the board rallied in Asia, with stocks outside Japan up nearly three percent at 0600 GMT in response to the agreement.

The euro hit a seven-week high.

Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said the final details on the Greek package, which follows a program of 110 billion euros of loans granted to the country last year, would only be worked out by year-end.

“The key is implementation.

This is the key. It is not enough to make commitments, it is necessary now to check if they are really implementing,” said Barroso.—Reuters

EU leaders reach euro agreement

October 27, 2011

Share this story

WRITING off half of the Greek debt and reinforcing the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) were the main decisions taken at last nights summit to save the euro.

At nearly 4.00, after 10 hours of discussions, what President Sarkozy has called a comprehensive response, an ambitious response, a credible response, is said to have been reached.

Banks and private investment funds with claims on Greek debt have agreed to renounce half of their entitlement from now until 2010, amounting to 100 billion off a total public debt of 350 billion.

Coupled with contributions from the European states of 130 billion in loans, this is expected to bring the Greek debt to 120% of its GDP by 2020, compared to 160%.

The EFSF, the main euro crisis bailout fund, financed by member states, is being increased to 1 trillion euros from 440 billion.

Among other aspects, it was agreed Eurozone summits will be held twice a year, presided by the EU president Herman Van Rompuy.

EU states are also meant to enact new laws, by the end of next year, standardising rules on balancing budgets, aimed at stability and growth.

The announcement that an agreement had been reached saw the Paris stock market rise this morning, by 2.43%.

President Sarkozy will appear live on France 2 and TF1 tonight answering questions about the decisions, from 20.15.

Euro hits 7 week high as Europe strikes deal

Europe debt crisis

TOKYO:

The euro hit a seven-week high on Thursday after EU leaders and banks reached a deal on a 50 per cent writedown for private bondholders on their Greek debt and made progress in other areas crucial to stemming the debt crisis.

The euro jumped 0.6 per cent to $1.4000 , breaking through a wall of orders and charging past stop-loss points on the way, also bolstered by the EU's progress on bank recapitalisation and its move to scale up the size of the euro zone's 440 billion euro ($600 billion) bailout fund, the EFSF.

Under the deal, the private sector agreed to voluntarily accept a nominal 50 per cent loss on its bond investments to reduce Greece's debt burden by 100 billion euros, cutting its debt to 120 per cent of GDP by 2020 from 160 per cent now.

While the final summit statement fell short of the detailed "comprehensive plan" many had hoped for, the leaders made enough progress to spark a relief rally across battered riskier assets.

The euro zone's rescue fund will be leveraged four or five times to about 1 trillion euros, but EU finance ministers are not expected to agree until November on the nitty-gritty elements of how the scaled up EFSF, or European Financial Stability Facility, will work.

"The devil is in the details here ... we don't actually know how they are planning to increase the bailout fund size from 440 billion euros to a trillion.

On top of that, there are some questions as to whether 1 trillion euros in itself is enough," said Damien Boey, an equity strategist at Credit Suisse in Sydney.

The euro's rally stalled at $1.4, around the level where an option barrier was rumoured to be placed, ahead of stop losses lurking at $1.4010-20 and resistance at $1.4013, a 61.8 per cent retracement of its August-October decline.

Against the yen, the euro was 0.4 per cent higher at 106.25 yen .

NEARING RECORD LOWS

The dollar zeroed in on a record low against the yen after the Bank of Japan, as widely expected, decided to ease policy by expanding asset purchases by 5 trillion yen ($65.8 billion), to 20 trillion yen.

The dollar dipped 0.3 per cent to 75.95 yen , a stone's throw from the record low of 75.71 yen plumbed the day before.

That was because some funds which went dollar long, expecting that Tokyo would deliver a "double punch" of easing and intervention at the same time, started dumping positions.

EU deal

LONDON:

World stocks and the euro rose to their highest levels in nearly two months on Thursday after European leaders struck a deal to resolve a two-year-old sovereign debt crisis, which threatens the survival of the single currency.

Brent crude and copper prices also rallied.

Prices of safe-haven US Treasuries and German Bunds fell, though those of highly indebted euro zone countries gained.

As concerns of a near-term default eased, the cost of insuring Greek debt against default also fell.

The deal, announced in the early hours of Thursday, will see private bondholders of Greek debt accept a 50 per cent loss on their investment, while banks will be recapitalised and the size of the currency bloc's rescue fund will be leveraged to 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion).

"Full credit to them for achieving something, even if it's not the be all and end all that we'd all really like but it takes us further away from the edge of the abyss for the time being," Nomura rate strategist Sean Maloney said.

Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 gained 2.6 per cent, while European bank shares , which have been hit by concerns that a Greek default would lead to a banking crisis, surged 5.8 per cent, with Greek bank stocks up 7.8 per cent.

Greece's share benchmark climbed 3.5 per cent and yields on 10-year Greek government bonds fell 67.2 basis points to 24.352 per cent, while yields on Italy's 10-year government bonds slipped 19.6 basis points to 5.735 per cent, also helped by the European Central Bank's bond buying, traders said.

World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index advanced 1.8 per cent to hit their highest level since early September.

The global benchmark is up 10.8 per cent so far this month, on track for its biggest monthly gain in more than two years, driven by hopes that euro zone policymakers would announce a decisive plan to end the turmoil at the summit.

Copper was up 2.8 per cent on Thursday and on track for its best weekly per centage gain since February 2009, while Brent crude rose 1.5 per cent to above $110 a barrel.

TOUGH ROAD AHEAD

But analysts said more work would still be needed to solve the bloc's problems.

"It would be clearly premature to declare the euro crisis as fully resolved.

Much more needs to be done, especially regarding fiscal consolidation," Credit Suisse Private Banking said.

"Achieving such a consolidation will be difficult in a phase of slow growth, or in some cases recession."

"Nevertheless, it is our impression that EU leaders have made significant progress on all fronts.

This suggests that the rebound in risk assets that has been underway in recent days may well continue for some time."

The euro was up 0.8 per cent at $1.4011 and 0.3 per cent at 106.24 yen.

"The market was short risk and long dollars, so this has boosted the euro.

But above $1.40, the air is a bit thin for the euro and it is likely to struggle there," Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS Global Banking, said.

The announcement also boosted high-yielding currencies, with the Australian dollar up 1.9 per cent at $1.0594.

The dollar zeroed in on a record low against the yen after the Bank of Japan, as widely expected, decided to ease policy by expanding asset purchases by 5 trillion yen ($65.8 billion), to 20 trillion yen.

The dollar was down 0.5 per cent at 75.83 yen , not far from the record low of 75.71 yen plumbed the day before.

European shares

LONDON:

European shares surged to a 12-week high in early trade on Thursday after euro zone leaders agreed to boost the region's rescue fund to 1 trillion euros and struck a deal with private lenders to accept a 50 per cent cut on their Greek bonds.

The private sector agreed to voluntarily accept a cut in its bond investments to reduce Greece's debt burden by 100 billion euros, while around 250 billion euros of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) will be leveraged 4 to 5 times to produce a headline figure of around 1 trillion.

"Even though details are not yet in place, the extension of the EFSF will build a firewall between Greece and the rest.

With the agreement on a 50 per cent haircut for Greece, quite a bit of uncertainty has been taken off the table as well," said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.

"It was very important to convince the market that this is a good plan.

The restoration of confidence is an important step in the healing process.

However, we will see whether the recovery in risky assets has legs."

At 0706 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 2.6 per cent at 1,009.45 points, the highest since early August.

The European banking sector , which has been hit hard by its large exposure to peripheral euro zone countries, spiked 4.5 per cent to top the gainers' list, following the agreement, which will be accompanied by a recapitalisation of the European banking sector by around 106 billion euros.

EU

BRUSSELS:

European Union (EU) talks with banks on bondholder losses as part of a second Greek rescue package are deadlocked and have been suspended, an EU official said.

The EU is seeking voluntary participation by banks, though a forced solution can't be ruled out, the official said in Brussels on Wednesday on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.

While policy makers and bankers are converging on a 50% writedown for Greece's lenders, the disagreement centered on the specifics of the transaction.

The dispute focused on how much of the risk of newly issued Greek bonds should be insured, the official said.

EU leaders meet in Brussels on Wednesday for the second summit in four days to try to reach an agreement to bolster the region's rescue fund, strengthen banks and relieve Greece to avoid the contagion spreading to Italy.

Agreement on the size of Greek losses would bring a step closer an announcement on how much additional capital banks will be required to raise to insulate themselves from losses on European sovereign debt.

That may involve the EU setting specific limits on its own and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) participation in the second bailout, the official said.

The Institute of International Finance, which lobbies on behalf of 450 financial firms, on Wednesday proposed investors make a larger writedown than the 40% the group offered last week, said two people with knowledge of the talks.

The European Union is calling on investors to forfeit as much as 60%, a person familiar with the talks said last week.

The latest proposal includes a 50% writedown on the net present value of Greek debt, said one of the people who declined to be identified because the talks are private.

Another person cautioned that the writedown may be closer to 45%. It's still uncertain whether EU leaders will accept even the increased offer, both people said.

Goal's to Cut Greek Debt to 120% of GDP

"Charles Dallara, managing director of the IIF, on behalf of private investors, made a significant offer last night for a voluntary bond exchange in support of Greece," IIF spokesman Frank Vogl said by telephone.

He declined to comment on the content of the offer.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel signaled she's aiming for a 50% writedown on Greek debt as part of a second rescue package.

The European Union has reached a deal that will see banks take a loss of 50 per cent on Greek bonds they have purchased -- an important step toward defusing the eurozone's debt crisis.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed the agreement at a press conference early Thursday after a marathon emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.

"The result will relieve the whole world that was expecting a decision that was strong from the eurozone," French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters at news conference, according to the BBC.

The assembled leaders also agreed to force Europe's major banks to raise $148 billion in an effort to strengthen them ahead of the expected losses on Greece's debt, and made headway toward a third agreement that would boost a joint bailout fund to $1.4 trillion.

The larger bailout fund is supposed to help keep Greece's debt -- which is expected to hit 180 percent of its economic output -- from enveloping larger countries including Italy and Spain.

EU leaders have been under incredible pressure to get the two-year-old debt crisis under control, following a number of delays and lackluster solutions.

The slow pace of progress has taken its toll on financial markets, stoking fears among investors that the crisis could lead to a recession across much of the developed world.

Financial leaders the world over have been watching the EU negotiations with concern.

Outside the summit, British Prime Minister David Cameron reassured reporters on Tuesday that "good progress" was being made toward dealing with the situation.

In Ottawa, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said Wednesday he expects the EU will move incrementally toward ending the debt crisis.

"We are confident that the European authorities understand the severity of the situation," he told reporters.

"We're also confident they understand the type of measures that need to be put in place."

However, Carney added that he does not expect that "the decisions of this week or next week or the following month in Europe are going to instantly solve all of the problems of the monetary union."

For now, he said the BoC is concerned about whether European leaders will be able to contain the situation if it worsens, or whether debt problems could spread to North America and other parts of the globe.

The agreement came at the end of marathon talks to finalize details of a comprehensive policy response to the government debt crisis threatening the stability of the Euro currency and global economy.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Greek bondholders voluntarily agreed to write down the value of Greek bonds by 50%, which translates to 100 billion Euros and will reduce the nation's debt load to 120% from 150%.

The result will relieve the whole world that was expecting a decision that was strong from the Euro zone, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said at a press conference in Brussels.

Sarkozy said the leaders agreed to boost the firepower of the EU bailout fund, known as the European Financial Stability Facility, by four or five fold. He added that officials have negotiated additional funding from the International Monetary Fund.

The write-downs were one of three inter-related problems political leaders must solve to devise a comprehensive solution to Europe's debt crisis.

They must also determine how to leverage a government-backed bailout fund and stabilize the banking sector.

European leaders persuaded bondholders to take 50% losses on Greek debt and boosted the firepower of the rescue fund to 1 trillion Euros, responding to global pressure to step up the fight against the financial crisis.

Ten hours of brinkmanship at the second crisis summit in four days delivered measures that the Euro area’s stewards said point the way out of the debt quagmire, even if key details are lacking.

Last-ditch talks with bank representatives led to the debt-relief accord, in an effort to quarantine Greece and prevent speculation against Italy and France from ravaging the Euro zone and wreaking global economic havoc.

“The world’s attention was on these talks today,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Brussels early Thursday.

“We Europeans showed tonight that we reached the right conclusions.”

Measures include a bigger role for the International Monetary Fund, a commitment from Italy to do more to reduce its debt and a signal from leaders that the European Central Bank will maintain bond purchases in the secondary market.

Europe’s leaders took the unusual step of summoning the banks’ representative, Managing Director Charles Dallara of the Institute of International Finance, into the summit to break the deadlock over how to cut Greece’s debt to 120% of GDP by 2020.

Dallara squared off with a group led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel around midnight after issuing an e-mailed statement that “there is no agreement on any element of a deal.”

ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, who has warned against the spillover effects of bond write-downs on the banking system, didn’t take part in the confrontation with Dallara.

Leaders backed two ways of leveraging up the 440 billion Euro rescue fund, which was designed last year to shield smaller countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, and lacks the heft to protect Italy, the euro area’s third-largest economy.

While the mechanics have yet to be worked out, European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said the leverage effect would multiply the power of the fund by a factor of four to five.

arnoldvinette@yahoo.comAnother solution to the European Debt Crisis

16:25, 27/10/2011

Another solution to the European Debt Crisis is to change how the underlying financial system works.

This solution will also instantly reduce all European government and military salary expenses (local, republic and federal) by at least 80%, eliminating future government debt problems.

“Work Credits” in its simplest form.

An economic reform proposal invented by a Canadian citizen to help the Russian people, may now be considered as an economic tool to reform the European economic system and money supply.

The new financial concept of "Work Credits" changes how a country values its money supply and how it values its citizens to do work that benefits their society.

The new financial concept of “Work Credits” revalues the country's money supply by valuing the European people as its MOST important natural resource.

People are valued to the European economy for example at $50,000 a year for 100 years, the life span of a human.

Citizen's value to country = (100 years – Person's age) x $50,000 a year

Country Money Supply = (100 years - Median population age) x $50,000 x population size

Country's Working Capital = Country money supply x 7% (for example)  This is to be used to fund country infrastructure projects, military purchases, healthcare and so forth.

Citizens are now all paid at the base rate of $50,000 a year to work for the government,  military, established company, be self employed, be a stay at home parent, go to school K to 12, college or university.

Work Credits eliminate unemployment, poverty and homelessness in all European countries.

An old age pension system is no longer required.

Unemployment insurance is no longer required.

These are now replaced with a person's lifetime economic value to their country to be paid back to them for work effort performed during their lifetime.

“Work Credits” does not equal equality.

Just that $50,000 of a person's salary is covered by their own economic value that is valued at $50,000 a year to do work that benefits their community, city, republic and country, what ever it may be and what ever is legal.

A country's money supply is now based on its most valuable natural resource, its people, and is now completely independent of available energy supplies in the form of fossil fuels and other natural resources.

This means that when oil and natural gas supplies run extremely low around 2030, the European governments can still keep 100% of its population working benefiting their community, city, republic, or country.

This is because people and their ability to do work is the basis of the country's money supply, not energy resources.

People will always be a country's MOST IMPORTANT natural resource to do work that benefits their society.

People will always be able to find work that will benefit their community, city, republic or country irregardless of available energy supplies.

Work will change, jobs will change, but the need for people to work to benefit their society will NEVER change.

It is this concept of “Work Credits” that ensures a smooth running society (irregardless of available energy supplies) now and into the future.

There has never been a better time to begin changing the economic foundation of Europe.

The credit crisis sweeping through Europe shows that it is time for this change to happen.

The financial concept of “Work Credits” empowers people to do work that benefits their society, but more importantly it enables European countries to value their money supplies in such a way that they can pay all of their citizens to do this work.

They key is NOT giving the central banks billions or trillions of Euros.

What is needed is a “Work Credit” based financial system that puts the money / “Work Credits” into the hands of the people who need it. Ordinary people who want to do work that benefits their society, what ever it may be and what is legal.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday last night's emergency summit of European Union leaders in Brussels had important results.

"We on the one hand discussed the necessary future steps and on the other agreed long-term reforms designed to improve European institutions and cooperation within the eurozone," Merkel said.

The EU leaders resolved to increase the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion) from the current 449 billion euros.

A deal was also reached to write off 50% of Greece's debt, to make the debt burden sustainable.

The country will also be able to receive up to 100 billion euro ($140 billion) of financial support from the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

"We have agreed a joint package of five elements:

firstly, it includes efforts by EU members;

secondly, long-term decisions for Greece;

thirdly, optimization of the EFSF;

fourthly, recapitalization of banks;

and fifthly - boosting stabilization framework in the eurozone," Merkel said.

European Union leaders agreed on Wednesday a plan to recapitalize banks so they can withstand the debt crisis, but the deal is contingent on the eurozone adopting a full package to protect the euro.

“We made good progress on the bank recapitalization, that wasn’t watered down, it now has been agreed,” British Prime Minister David Cameron said after a meeting of the 27-nation EU, which preceded talks among the eurozone’s 17 leaders.

“It will only go ahead when the other parts of the full package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight,” Cameron told reporters.

With fears growing that the eurozone debt drama will turn into a banking system meltdown, European leaders want the banks to boost their core capital buffers so they can absorb expected losses on their holdings of Greek debt.

 All leaders stressed their common resolve to do their utmost to overcome the crisis and to help face, in a spirit of solidarity, the challenges confronting the European Union

But eurozone negotiators were struggling to convince banks to accept a write down of at least 50 percent, with bankers offering 40 percent instead.

“We discussed the situation and all leaders stressed their common resolve to do their utmost to overcome the crisis and to help face, in a spirit of solidarity, the challenges confronting the European Union and the Euro area,” EU president Herman Van Rompuy said.

“Short term recapitalization is needed in the current exceptional circumstances to create a temporary buffer allowing the banking system to withstand shocks in a reliable manner,” he said in a statement.

In a summit statement, EU leaders said measures to restore confidence in Europe’s banks “are urgently needed and are necessary in the context of strengthening prudential control of the EU banking sector.”

They declared a “broad agreement” for banks to increase their core Tier 1 capital ratio to 9.0 percent of assets by June 30, 2012 − this is two percentage points higher and seven years earlier than under new international banking rules recently agreed in the Basel III regulators accord.

Banks must first try to raise funds through “private sources of capital, including through restructuring and conversion of debt to equity instruments.”

Until the target is reached, the statement said, “banks should be subject to constraints regarding the distribution of dividends and bonus payments.”

Governments should provide aid if necessary, the document says.

But if such aid is impossible among eurozone nations, the bloc’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, could provide the money.

The declaration is devoid of any monetary figures but EU sources said recapitalization would amount to 108 billion euros ($150 billion) − although the precise amount needed will depend on how much Greek debt the banks are willing to write off.

Merkel, Sarkozy ready to talk with banks on Greek debt cut

Herman Van Rompuy, EU president

The leaders of France and Germany, President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel, will Wednesday talk in person to world bankers to negotiate a reduction in Greek debt, a senior government source said Wednesday.

“They want to speak to the banks this evening,” said the source, who is close to the negotiations but spoke on condition of anonymity.

The source said Europe would not rule out arm-twisting the bank lobby, whereas previously all the emphasis had been on securing “voluntary” agreement so as to avoid triggering credit default insurance clauses.

The EU wants banks to take a write-down of 50-60 percent on their holdings of Greek government bonds, targeting a 100-billion-euro reduction in the 350-billion debt mountain in Athens.

One top French governmental source said a “plan B” that would see Greece face a formal debt restructuring was an alternative, if a suitable deal for taxpayer-funded bailout partners cannot be found.

The idea is that the ratio of Greek debt-to-GDP falls from the current 160 percent to 120 percent, still way about the EU 60 percent limit but more manageable.

Germany has been militant in pressing for a bigger haircut, while France had erred on the side of the European Central Bank which warned of the risk that banks could suddenly withdraw funding from other vulnerable eurozone governments.

Italy commits to presenting growth plan

Italy has told its European partners that it will present a growth plan by November 15, the Ansa news agency reported Wednesday, citing a letter sent by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to a Brussels summit.

The letter of intent, demanded by Berlusconi’s European peers as part of efforts to solve the eurozone debt crisis, also includes a plan to raise the retirement age to 67 from 2026, a measure negotiated with the premier’s Northern League coalition partner, Ansa said.

Among other commitments made, the government said companies would now be freer to lay-off staff while it would also adopt a similar stance on civil servant employment.

Italy has been put on the spot at the summit, with Germany and France pressing Berlusconi to deliver a clear cut plan to boost growth and cut spending so as to ensure his country is not the next victim of a eurozone debt crisis which has already claimed Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

The Italian premier waved as he arrived in Brussels but ignored reporters’ questions, three days after a first summit at which Merkel and Sarkozy told him to come back with answers.

His response was keenly awaited at a summit focused on finding a lasting solution to the eurozone debt crisis, with plans to cut Greece’s crippling debt, recapitalize banks and boost the firepower of the bloc’s bailout fund.

“Our Italian friends know that we must go with the principle that tonight it will be announced that Italy will make important (budgetary) consolidation and structural (reform) efforts,” said Luxembourg premier Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the group of 17 eurozone finance ministers.

“This is a must.”

Today is a crucial day for the eurozone as its leaders are meeting in Brussels to try to finalize a plan to handle Europe`s debt crisis.

Experts hold different views on a possible outcome of the meeting as there are too many issues which require their attention.

So, it came as no surprise when the Vatican offered its assistance on the problem.

Analysts believed that even if the EU leaders fail to agree on each detail of the plan, today`s summit will certainly outline the agenda for the G20 summit in Cannes next month.

In an exclusive interview with the VoR, Russia`s presidential aide Arkady Dvorkovich sounded quite optimistic about the outcome of the summit:

"They have everything to attain the objective, - political leverage, financial resources and support throughout the world.

After all, today Eurozone stability is the key factor in the efforts to avoid global recession, to avoid another wave of crisis.

The Eurozone leaders can rely on that support, so they can and should make the decision.

Certainly, every country has its own home political problems and would like to share the financial burden and risks with someone else, with the private sector.

But then, risks should be shared.

The main thing is that the decision is made today.

I think this will prove the case and such decision will calm down the markets," Dvorkovich said.

Russian financial analyst Denis Barabanov thinks that a two-day delay following the failed Sunday meeting could not but bring a breakthrough into the negotiation process:

"We are not going to hear any serious statements.

Certainly, they have to please the public with some definite measures, but I think they won`t offer more than a plan for the recapitalization of banks.

Nevertheless, there are several possible solutions, and it would be better if banks recapitalized without assistance from the stability fund.

Secondly, the fund itself could have been increased, though I don`t think this is going to happen," the analyst said.

As of today, the lending capacity of the EFSF is €440 billion.

It was agreed on Sunday not to increase the size of the fund, though before it had been planned to boost the EFSF capacity up to€2 trillion in order to save euro amid default fears in Greece and also to provide bailouts to other weak economies in the eurozone.

Norway then announced it was ready to use its oil fund to help ease the debt crisis.

But chief economist for Finam Management, Alexander Osin, thinks that such risks are overestimated:

"The EFSF can issues bonds to support eurozone countries in financial troubles.

As of today, such bonds were issued only for Ireland and Portugal, with both countries having used only the tenth part of the bonds.

Honestly, I do not see the reason for such pessimistic predictions.

Probably, these are fears of speculation."

Chances are low for a breakthrough to be made on the Greek issue, which has been hanging like a sword of Damocles over the eurozone for two consecutive years.

Greek debt restructuring remains a high-priority issue.

After the sides had failed to agree on this question by 17 September, the EU summit was postponed for a week.

But no agreement has been reached on the issue so far.

Jean - Claude Juncker, head of the Eurogroup meeting of eurozone finance ministers, said that the Greek bondholders might settle for a cut of 60 percent in what Athens owes them to ensure the country`s economic development.

“But the proposed cut is too high for European banks’, says Russian financial analyst Denis Barabanov:

"Sixty percent is too much.

I do not think that Germany and France will accept it because it would create a risky precedent for other European countries.

Obviously, Greece is the most likely country to face a default, but similar problems should not be ruled out in Italy and Spain next year.

And they might simply fancy the idea of not bothering about cutting the budget deficit but just easing the debt burden by writing it off. I think a Greek cut will be up to 40%."

Statements made by different politicians are adding fuel to the fire amid rumors and provocative reports accompanying the EU summits on the eurozone crisis.

The President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, was seen demonstrating his annoyance on the results of the talks, while the French leader Nicolas Sarkozy and the UK Prime Minister David Cameron exchanged bitter remarks during a meeting on Sunday.

So, those who are being skeptical about the euro may celebrate:

the British parliament nearly approved a referendum on quitting the EU. The ‘separatists’ explained their position:

“We do not want to be ruled by non-elective and irresponsible Brussels officials”.

The Vatican has joined criticism of the EU`s handling of the crisis.

A statement released by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, urges for the creation of a global central bank since the national institutions fail to address the crisis successfully.

The Vatican added that the existing financial system ‘lacks ethics’ and ‘sparks inequality and strive for wealth’.

In the Middle Ages money-lenders were persecuted by the Inquisition.

Taking into account how things unfold now, similar measures may be promoted today through the Occupy Wall Street style protests.

The extra summit of the EU and the countries of the euro-zone has kicked off in Brussels.

The leaders of 27 EU’s members states of which 17 are also the members of the euro-zone are to approve an anti-crisis plan to save the Euro.

The document which has been prepared since spring envisages restructuring of Greece’s debt on the level of 40-60%, recapitalization of the European banking system and expansion of its stabilization mechanisms.

Russia and China have already declared their readiness to consider participation in financial support of stabilization measures for the euro zone.

TASS

Interview with Simon Tilford, Chief Economist with the London-based Center for European Reform.

How do you assess the decisions that were taken today?

It’s certainly a comprehensive agreement – that’s clear, but will it solve the crisis?

I think it will certainly not. If we break it down into two-three components, the most important of which is the rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund, what they are essentially saying is that this fund will be allowed to leverage up.

So, what they are saying is that about 250 billion euros will be used to ensure government’s debt insurance, so basically they will ensure 20 percent of the value of Italy’s or Greece’s new government bond insurance – that basically means that they can leverage up that fund from 250 trillion euros to a billion euros or a bit more, depending on what precise proportion they agree to insure.

The problem with that is that nobody knows whether investors will actually be sufficiently reassured by that to buy the debt, because they are not putting any new funds into this, basically they are just allowing the EFSF to behave like the bank, but the bank, of course, is backed by central bank and its government, there is nothing behind this.

Also all of the eurozone is responsible for ensuring this.

Does it make sense for Italy to insure itself to issue debt, so there was some fundamental promise with that?

That’s the biggest problem and it makes no progress to allow the European Central Bank to behave like a fully empowered central bank, so it’s not been empowered to provide a full range of lender of last resort functions ‑ basically, it’s not allowed to do what the US Fed does, or the Bank of Japan, or the Bank of England, or any of the other developed countries’ central banks.

So, there has not been any progress on that and I think the markets will respond very skeptically for that.

On the two other major sort of planks of this agreement on bank recapitalization in Greece we’ve seen some progress, but again there are some question marks.

They’ve agreed or they’ve announced an agreement that private creditors will take voluntary loses or so-called haircuts on the lending to the Greek government of about 50 percent and that the eurozone has also agreed to write off a bit of that debt.

Overall this agreement will only reduce Greece’s debt to GDP from about 160 percent to about 120 percent by 2015 or something like that, so perhaps it’s not enough if we look at what’s happening in Greece – Greece’s debt to GDP ratio is 120 percent.

Why would that enable Greece to reaccess the financial markets is an open question, and that’s highly unlikely that Greece would need much bigger debt write-off than that, it probably needs 60-70 percent of the overall debt burden, not just the debts that the country has with its private creditors.

Then we have the bank recapitalization, before they have agreed to inject substantial funds into the banks…

From where?

This is going to be mainly from national government which is short of cash.

The question mark there is what impact this will have on country’s fiscal positions, because the countries that need to inject most into their banks are the same countries that are having problems on the sovereign debt markets.

So, all over the eurozone will contribute a bit to this, the national governments should come up with the money and so we could see them struggling to do that.

If the banks themselves trying to raise the money, the risk there is that they will have to pay from their capital and that they would rather nurturing their balance sheets and lending instead.

So, it’s certainly not a game changer, it’s not going to put the eurozone on a sustainable footing.

On the rescue foundation they need to allow the ECB to do what a central bank should be doing which is to backstop the sovereign debt over the member states in the way the US Fed does, or the Bank of Japan does, or the Bank of England.

They need to decide one way or the other on Greece - either the country is not going to default and it needs to be nursed back to growth and that’s sustainability with its given level of debt – that looks implausible;

or they need to cut its debt by enough to enable Greece to make its own way – that would involve much bigger cuts that we are seeing, it would require much bigger cuts than implausible in public sector and lending to Greece and we would require centrally funded recapitalization of the banks – not nationally based recapitalization.

There was another thing which I actually found a little bit alarming or perhaps puzzling.

Reuters reported that Mr. Sarkozy said he would talk to the Chinese President Hu Jintao about attracting investors into some kind of special purpose vehicle.

Reuters is also saying that Beijing has so far being a big buyer of bonds issued by the EFSF.

Does that mean that we are suggesting to Beijing to expand its role in the European finances?

Yes, I think it’s quite puzzling.

Why do they think it makes sense to be dependent on funding from what is still a developing country with hundreds of millions of very poor people?

Europe despite its problems is one of the most stable bits of the world, so why do they think it makes sense to open up their fund of dependency with the Chinese?

I find it very puzzling.

But this is what happens when you refuse to acknowledge the underline problem they have in the eurozone which is institutionally incomplete.

This is what happens when you are refusing to address the underline problems and other way-outs to stopgap measures to solve this issue.

I think inviting Chinese participation is just one example.

There is no problem at all with the Chinese investing in the EFSF, investing in the eurozone government bonds, but to try to enlist them in it - I find it very puzzling.

Forex Europe News – EU Summit ends successfully with agreement on Greek bond haircut

Marathon talks at the EU Summit last night in Brussels finally ended eight hours later with success on reaching some agreements on how to deal with the sovereign debt crisis.

First on the agenda was Greek debt and the amount on bond haircuts.

It was decided that private bondholders will accept a 50 percent write-down on their holdings of Greek debt.

 This will result in reducing Greece’s debt by 100 billion euros.

The remainder of the debt is to be re-financed at a lower interest rate.

 Consequently the remaining debt  will be equal to 120 percent of GDP, lower than the current 160 percent.

Also a big success was coming to an agreement to beef up the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) through leveraging.

This would result in increasing the rescue fund from 440 billion euro to as much as 1 trillion euros.

By scaling up the fund, this would help contain debt from engulfing Italy and Spain, which are larger economies that the other indebted euro zone economies that the fund has already been used to provide help, which includes Ireland, Portugal and Greece.

EU finance ministers have until November to agree on the details of how the scaled up EFSF will work.

Also at the Summit, plans were made to increase PSI (private sector involvement) in Greece.

Finally, agreeing on recapitalisation of the European banking sector by around 106 billion euros, will prevent the sovereign debt crisis from spreading to the banking sector.

The euro gained strength after the successful conclusion of the Summit and has hit a six week high against the US dollar.

Debt crisis:

EU leaders reach bailout agreement

CNN-IBN | 27-Oct 08:47 AM

New Delhi:

Another financial crisis was averted in Europe as the European Union leaders reached a bailout agreement after a marathon brainstorming session.

The agreement included a hard-fought deal with private sector investors to write down Greek bonds by 50 per cent.

The agreement came at the end of a marathon round of talks to finalise the details of a comprehensive policy response to the government debt and banking problems threatening the stability of the euro currency and global economy.

The deal struck included 50 per cent writedown for private bondholders.

Earlier, EU leaders brainstomred and discussed plans to prop up European banks, ease the debt burden on Greece and enlarge the bailout fund meant to prevent major economies such as Italy falling into crisis.

Fears of a failure in talks meant that the International Monetary Fund might have had to support the eurozone.

The value of that package, EU sources said, would be 130 billion euros - up from 109 billion euros when a deal was last struck in July, an agreement that subsequently unraveled.

"The summit allowed us to adopt the components of a global response, of an ambitious response, of a credible response to the crisis that is sweeping across the euro zone," French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters afterwards.

As well as the deal on deeper private sector participation in Greece - which emerged after Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel personally engaged in the negotiations with bankers - euro zone leaders also agreed to scale up the European Financial Stability Facility, their 440 billion euro ($600 billion) bailout fund set up last year.

The fund has already been used to provide help to Ireland, Portugal and Greece, leaving around 290 billion euros available.

Around 250 billion of that will be leveraged 4-5 times, producing a headline figure of around 1.0 trillion euros, which will be deployed in a variety of ways.

Leaders hope that will be enough to stave off any worsening of the debt problems in Italy and Spain, the region's third and fourth largest economies respectively.

The EFSF will be leveraged in two ways, either by offering insurance, or first-loss guarantees, to purchasers of euro zone debt in the primary market, or via a special purpose investment vehicle that will be set up in the coming weeks and which is aimed at attracting investment from China and Brazil.

The methods could be combined, giving the EFSF greater flexibility, the euro zone leaders said.

"The leverage could be up to one trillion (euros) under certain assumptions about market conditions and investors' responsiveness in view of economic policies," said Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council.

"There is nothing secret in all this, it is not easy to explain but we are going to more with our available money, it is not that spectacular.

Banks have been doing this for centuries, it has been their core business, with certain limits."

BRUSSELS | Thu Oct 27, 2011 2:13am IST

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone leaders intend to scale up their emergency rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, to give it an estimated firepower of about 1 trillion euros ($1.38 trillion), EU sources said on Wednesday.

The sources said the 440 billion euro EFSF fund would have between 250 and 275 billion euros available after providing aid to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, and that the money could be quadrupled using a special vehicle and a debt-insurance scheme.

"The ratio of the leverage will be of at least four times," one source said, while another said the spare capacity available to be leveraged was up to 275 billion euros.

The final firepower of the fund, designed to convince markets that the euro zone could cope with borrowing problems in Spain and Italy, can only be finalised, however, after finance ministers talk to investors to judge their appetite for European debt.

They will want to see what risk premium cautious investors, ranging from countries like China to fund managers, will demand to buy bonds in the euro zone.

That could rise, depending on the scale of losses investors end up shouldering on their Greek debt.

If private-sector owners of Greek sovereign bonds are forced to take heavy losses rather than accepting them voluntarily, investors could be even more hesitant.

Two models are on the table to bolster the fund's firepower.

One would be a type of euro state-sponsored insurance scheme offered to buyers of Spanish bonds, for example, that would make a payout if Spain were to default.

Euro zone states hope that by giving this guarantee they could encourage otherwise reluctant investors to buy.

"Purchasing this risk insurance would be offered to private investors as an option when buying bonds in the primary market," according to a draft of a statement by euro zone leaders.

The second model involves setting up a special purpose investment vehicle, giving foreign investors a less risky way to buy euro zone debt.

"The EFSF will have the flexibility to deploy... these two options simultaneously," the draft statement said.

The exact amount of capital available for leverage will only be known once negotiations over a second bailout package for Greece are finalised.

The private owners of Greek bonds may receive an offer to swap their bonds at a discount for new ones backed by a guarantee of the EFSF, similar to the so-called Brady bond scheme used in Latin America.

But that guarantee comes at a cost to the EFSF -- bigger guarantees or credit enhancements will cut the amount of funds in the EFSF for leveraging.

Sony Kapoor, managing director of financial think tank Re-Define and who is close to the discussions on leveraging, said it was far too early to specify the potential firepower of the fund.

"It's good to have targets, but that is all they are," Kapoor said.

"Until they have talked to investors, they will not know what level of guarantees are needed to get Spanish and Italian borrowing costs down to reasonable level," he said.

"The leveraging effect depends on the risk premium investors want to invest in euro zone debt."

Finally, Europe has a deal

By Ben Rooney @ CNNMoney October 27, 2011:

12:06 PM ET

Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas shakes hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as EU leaders reach an agreement to solve Europe's debt crisis.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- European Union leaders announced an agreement early Thursday on debt crisis measures, including a hard-fought deal with private sector investors to take a 50% loss on Greek bonds.

The agreement came at the end of marathon talks to finalize the policy response to the government debt and banking problems threatening the stability of the euro currency and global economy.

Comment

The response aims to resolve three related problems:

the debt crisis in Greece, instability in the banking sector and a sorely outgunned bailout fund.

Under the new plan, Greek bondholders agreed to voluntarilay write down the value of Greek bonds by 50%, which translates into €100 billion and will reduce the nation's debt load to 120% of economic output by 2020.

The private sector agreed to the writedowns on the condition of a €30 billion contribution from the public sector, according to Charles Dallara, director of the Institute of International Finance, which represented the private sector in the talks.

"We look forward to work with the Greek and European authorities to translate this framework into a concrete agreement that can deliver an early reduction in Greece's debt and place it squarely on a path toward debt sustainability," Dallara said in a statement.

(Read: Greece faces pushback in its austerity drive )

The agreement also calls for a new €100 billion financing program for Greece, which will be funded partly by the International Monetary Fund, according to an official EU statement.

Stronger bailout fund:

The leaders agreed on two ways to increase the firepower of the EU bailout fund, known as the European Financial Stability Facility.

The methods will each leverage the fund by four or five fold, the statement said, boosting its resources to about €1 trillion.

The fund will be used to partially insure new issues of government bonds.

In addition, it will be supplemented by the creation of one or more special investment vehicles, which will be open to private sector players such as sovereign wealth funds.

China has already expressed interest in backing the special investment mechanism.

The possibility that China could back the the rescue effort helped lift U.S. stock prices late Wednesday.

Bigger bank reserves:

The EU government heads also agreed to raise capital requirements for banks vulnerable to losses on euro-area government bonds.

"The overarching goal of the exercise is to foster confidence in the European banking sector," said European Council president Herman Van Rompuy.

0:00 / 02:43 SAP:

No fear of Eurozone unrest

Banks would be required to sharply increase core capital levels to 9% to create a buffer against potential losses.

Based on market rates in September, banks will need to raise a total of €106 billion to meet the new targets, according to the European Banking Authority.

That compares with estimates from the International Monetary Fund and private sector economists that ranged between €100 and €300 billion.

The banks would have until the end of June 2012 to meet those new requirements, according to a statement.

José Barroso, president of the European Commission, said the technical work needed to complete the measures will be completed "in the coming weeks."

"The key is implementation," said Barroso.

"It is not enough to make commitments."

Ministers thrash out Eurozone deal

Category:

Date:

27/10/2011

Shares across the Eurozone improved this morning after European Union ministers announced a resolution to the debt crisis talks.

Stock markets jumped in London, Frankfurt and Paris, while the euro rose against the dollar and the pound.

As part of the deal thrashed out by the leaders of the 27 EU nations, private debt owed by Greece will be trimmed in half, with banks agreeing to receive 50% of the money they are owed.

It means that the country will owe 120% of its gross domestic product in debts by 2020, not 180% as would have been the case.

The markets reacted positively to the deal, with the FTSE 100 up by 2.23% to 5677.06 this morning, while the German Dax index rose by 3.68%.

France's Cac 40 index rose by 3.82% following the news, with shares in Greece surging by almost 5%.

Stocks also increased in the Far East and Australia yesterday.

As part of the deal, the size of the Eurozone Financial Stability Facility, which acts as a bailout fund, is set to be significantly increased from 440 billion euros to 1 trillion euros (£880 billion).

The fund has been used to protect bailout economies such as the Republic of Ireland and Portugal, with an enlargement agreed to protect other struggling economies, such as Spain and Italy.

However, there are fears that the 1 trillion euro fund will still not prove to be enough, with the amount at the lower end of what analysts predict is needed.

And to protect against losses from defaults, banks across the EU have been told to raise around 106 billion euros.

It is hoped that by improving their liquidity, the major banks across the continent will effectively shield themselves from private or public defaults.

E.U. leaders agree to stem debt crisis

Submitted  1 day 2 hrs ago

European leaders moved early Thursday to stem the debt crisis gripping the continent by agreeing to a plan that imposes steep losses on investors holding troubled Greek bonds and boosts the firepower of the regions bailout fund to at least a trillion dollars.

After marathon negotiations that continued well past midnight, European leaders said banks and other major investors in Greek bonds agreed to take losses of up to 50 percent.

This concession was meant to help prevent the Greek government from defaulting on bills it cannot pay and avoid an even costlier shock to the European financial system.

BEIJING, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- It took an allnighter for eurozone leaders to finally agree on a package of measures to battle the region's debt crisis early Thursday, including a 50-percent writedown of the Greek government debt and expand the continent's bailout fund.

After the marathon session, sighs of relief were heard worldwide, with both Asian stocks and the euro advancing on the news.

EU leaders from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou were jubilant, while IMF head Christine Lagarde called the latest deal a "significant progress."

However, details of the deal package still need to be worked out and new rounds of haggling are expected as each stakeholder would assert its own interests.

Thus the international community needs to keep reminding Europe that as a whole, the continent should shoulder its due responsibilities and take swift action to curb the crisis.

In a globalized world which is growing ever smaller, the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis has already swept over the whole continent and is now threatening the whole world.

It is true that the eurozone crisis is closely related to the unstable recovery of the global economy against the backdrop of the international financial crisis, but it is in essence the result of a long-term accumulation of internal mechanism problems within the EU.

The two-year-old eurozone debt saga has exposed the EU's deep-seated weakness and lack of financial supervision institutions.

In the short and medium term, emergency bailout measures and budgetary austerity plans may be effective in alleviating the crisis.

However, a permanent solution may only be found in revamping the institutions within the EU.

Under these circumstances Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has suggested that fundamental financial reforms are needed in addition to emergency bailout measures.

In a phone conversation with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy last Friday, Wen also made it clear that "China stands ready to beef up coordination and cooperation with the EU to contribute to a global economic recovery."

While China and other emerging countries indicated they won't be bystanders of the Eurozone crisis, it would be unfair to ask them to shoulder the same responsibility as those directly responsible for the crisis.

Emerging economies should not be seen as the EU's Good Samaritans -- in the end, the EU has to pull itself out of the crisis.

Yet a prosperous, stable Europe is of great importance to the world's stability and development, China's top political advisor Jia Qinglin said during his visit to debt-ridden Greece on Monday.

China has been a long-term investor in the sovereign debt market of Europe, and will continue to support Europe and the euro currency in the future, Jia said.

For the EU itself, all member states need to keep in mind the fact that they are in the same boat and solve their differences with mutual trust.

As Van Rompuy has put it, they must confront the common challenges "in a spirit of solidarity."

BERLIN, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- German lower house of parliament gave a green light on boosting the firepower of the eurozone rescue fund, or the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), on Wednesday.

The parliamentary approval gave Chancellor Angela Merkel a strong backing and mandate to negotiate ahead of a crucial European Union (EU) summit in Brussels later Wednesday.

The result, with 503 votes of support from 620 seats, was in line with previous expectation, as the two main opposition parties, the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens, have promised Tuesday to back the new version of the rescue plan, drafted by EU leaders after a closely watched summit on Sunday.

Merkel's conservative party decided Monday to push for a full vote on the new changes of the eurozone rescue package, although it would be enough for the parliament's budget committee to endorse them.

The decision, which eventually granted Merkel sufficient authority for following talks with other EU partners, came against a backdrop that German highest court ruled last month that the parliament have a bigger say and deeper involvement in the eurozone bailout issues.

Before the voting, Merkel urges EU countries to tackle the very root of the debt crisis, saying that the eurozone need a strong "firewall" to contain the crisis from further spreading.

She also urges stricter EU rules and supervision for those who permanently and repeatedly breach the Stability and Growth Pact, an EU treaty that demands its member states' deficits is no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).

The chancellor also stressed that the private sector should help significantly to solve the debt trouble of Greece.

According to text draft obtained by media after Sunday's summit, banks would have to accept a "voluntary" write-down of 50-60 percent on their Greek bond holdings.

In July summit, the "haircut" by private sector was only 21 percent.

Following the vote, Merkel is due to fly to Brussels for another marathon negotiation.

All eyes are now on whether the EU leaders can finally hammer out a comprehensive and convincing reaction plan to the escalating debt crisis on Wednesday's summit, the second one in four days.

The new resolution, as it was passed by German parliament, will reportedly introduce two methods of leveraging the EFSF -- one method is to use the EFSF to partly guarantee the bonds of weak eurozone states and the other is to establish a special purpose investment vehicle (SPIV), supported by other players like the International Monetary Fund.

The German government promised that all these methods under discussion would not give more burdens to German taxpayers, most of who are also voters and have been unsatisfied with Merkel's handling of crisis.

Germany currently guarantees loans up to 211 billion euros, or nearly half of the total eurozone rescue fund, making itself the largest paymaster among eurozone states.

BERLIN, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel Wednesday said the eurozone debt crisis and fundamental weakness of European Union (EU) economic framework should be tackled at the roots.

Speaking in the Bundestag, or the lower house of parliament, Merkel said that the ongoing eurozone crisis was attributed to two main causes, namely unbearable debts of some member states and a lack of economic competitiveness of these countries.

"We must tackle the cause of the crisis at the root," she said, adding that the eurozone need decisive measures to contain the crisis from further spreading.

"The next step is to exert influence on countries that permanently and repeatedly breach the Stability and Growth Pact," Merkel stressed, referring to a series of EU economic guidelines, including keeping a country's deficit no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).

Merkel told lawmakers that it is a now-or-never moment to solve the fundamental problems of eurozone.

"The fundamental weaknesses and holes in the construction of the economic and monetary union must either be addressed now or, I say, never," said Merkel.

Merkel urged that the EU should be determined to change its treaties to avoid similar troubles in the future, even though it may take a long time and face some risks.

The amendments should anchor "a culture of stability in Europe" and give EU organizations, such as the European Court of Justice, more power to maintain disciplines of finance and economy.

Merkel insisted that any rescue fund for heavily indebted countries should be "always be linked to strict conditions."

As for the upcoming G20 summit in France, Merkel said her country would continue to campaign for an international financial transaction tax, a mechanism that can reserve resources for countries in case of another economic crisis, ensuring that taxpayers need not to foot the bill for bankers or investors.

"We cannot continue with the 'too big to fail' thing," Merkel said, adding that all EU countries should install a debt brake.

Although Germany is stable at the moment, but the country could not continue to go well alone if the whole Europe fail, she said.

Hours after Merkel's speech, German lower house of parliament approved a resolution on boosting the firepower of the eurozone rescue fund, or the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) with an overwhelming majority, which gave Merkel a strong backing and mandate to negotiate ahead of a crucial EU summit in Brussels later Wednesday.

President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso (L) and President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy attend a press conference after an EU summit in Brussels, capital of Belgium, on Oct. 27, 2011.

European leaders announced early Thursday morning that a long-awaited rescue plan to fight the euro debt crisis has been reached, which included a 50 percent writedown on the value of the Greek bonds held by private investors.

(Xinhua/Wu Wei)

BRUSSELS, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders agreed early Thursday morning a long-awaited deal on combatting the ongoing debt crisis, under which private creditors will write off 50 percent of the value of the Greek bonds they hold.

"We have reached a sustainable solution for Greece," said European Council President Herman Van Rompuy at a press conference held after a prolonged eurozone summit which dragged from Wednesday evening to Thursday morning.

Under the eurozone summit deal, a new EU-International Monetary Fund (IMF) program of up to 100 billion euros (137 billion U.S. dollars) will be put in place by the end of the year for Greece to help Greece reduce its public debt to 120 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.

To reach the goal, "a voluntary contribution by private creditors who had lent to Greece" is needed, and the private holders of the Greek debt have agreed to take a nominal discount of 50 percent on notional Greek debt, Van Rompuy told reporters.

BRUSSELS, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- European leaders agreed early Thursday that private creditors have to accept a 50 percent cut in the value of the Greek government debt they hold, and the bailout fund would be increased to 1 trillion euros (1.37 trillion U.S. dollars).

"We have reached a sustainable solution for Greece," said Herman Van Rompuy, the European Council president, at a press conference held after a prolonged eurozone summit which dragged from Wednesday evening to Thursday morning.

To reduce Greece's public debt to 120 percent of its GDP in 2020, a voluntary contribution by private holders of Greek debt is needed, and they have agreed to take a nominal discount of 50 percent on notional Greek debt, Van Rompuy told reporters.

The EU leader also hailed a "sufficient firewall against contagion, thanks to an agreement to multiply by fourfold the firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue fund" to increase it to 1 trillion euros.

To bolster the firepower of the EFSF, the eurozone has identified two approaches, including giving credit enhancement to sovereign bonds issued by eurozone member states and creating Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) to provide finance to EFSF's operations.

Either of the approaches could lead to leverage of 4 or 5 times, and the two can be used simultaneously, so as to increase the robustness of the financing strategy, said Van Rompuy.

The announcement came hours after EU countries agreed to raise the core capital ratio of the European banks to 9 percent by June 30, 2012 during a preceding EU summit.

By approving a co-ordinated scheme to recapitalize banks across Europe, "We foster confidence in the European banking sector," and this will enable the banks to withstand shocks in the current exceptional circumstances, said Van Rompuy.

Under the recapitalization plan, banks should first use private sources of capital, including through restructuring and conversion of debt to equity instruments.

If banks are unable to raise enough fund themselves, national governments should provide support, according to a statement issued after the EU summit.

"When the national support is not available, recapitalization should be funded via a loan from the EFSF," said the statement.

EU debt crisis rescue on the horizon

EU leaders have agreed to raise the minimum capital adequacy ratio of the largest banks in the EU up to 9% after hours of fractious debate in the early hours of Thursday in Brussels.

­Banks to take 50% Greek Hit

­Private investors agreed to develop a voluntary bond exchange with a nominal discount of 50% to Greek debt in a 100 billion euro bailout deal that also strengthens European rescue fund, and calls for recapitalization of Greek banks.

French president Nicolas Sarkozy said private sector investors would refinance Greek's remaining debt at preferential rates while governments would fork out 30 billion euro. 

“Private Sector Involvement should secure the 50% decline of the Greek debt with an objective of reaching 120% by 2020 to GDP ratio.

The new programme should be agreed by the end of 2011 and the exchange of bonds should be implemented at the beginning of 2012,” 

­Bailout backup

­This time the Eurogroup made a clear decision on disbursing the 6th tranche of EU/IMF cash for Greece, with the help of resources from private and public financial institutions and investors.

As a part of bailout programme EU leaders insisted that the 440 billion Euro bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), would be increased four to five times to 1 trillion euro.

­“Unfair Default”

­Andrey Vernikov, Deputy Director for investment analysis at IC Zerich Capital Management, says the EU plan on Greece debts reduction encourages moral risks of the financial system

“This is a plan of “unfair default”.

The main idea was to attract as many interested private investors to reanimate depleting Greece economy on the voluntary basis in order to postpone on Greece default.”

However, the strategy's effectiveness will depend on the details, which will have to be finalised in the coming days and weeks.

­Markets rally

­Russian shares jumped with both Russian Stock exchange indexes also up in early Thursday trading on the back of the EU summit's decisions regarding Greece’s debt and the recapitalization of banks.

Cross Atlantic stocks also hailed the EU decision with Dow Jones index up1.39%, while Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.46%, and S&P 500 up 1.05%. 

According to Dmitry Lobanov, Head of sales at IF Olma, stocks will continue to rise, since “the outcome of EU summit can be considered moderately favorable for the market.”

Lobanov added that Russian banks were driving growth “By 10:57 Moscow time RTS index was up 5.45% and the MICEX index gained 2.43% with benchmark stocks raising 4%, led by VTB and Sberbank.”

European leaders have dithered and delayed reaction to the evolving debt crisis, after spending 18 months discussing without decisive actions.

Today, EU leaders will meet again in Brussels to finalize a new plan to recapitalize European banks.

The current debt crisis developed in the late 2000s among fiscally conservative investors whose concerns were related to the sovereign debt of several European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010.

In the so-called "PIIGS" countries – Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain -and also some EU countries outside euro zone -a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on credit default swaps between these countries and other EU members, most importantly Germany.

Although European Union leaders will discuss the next step to end the debt crisis, no decision is expected to be announced.

However, a clear conclusion on the nature of the bailout plan will be made.

“Now is the time that we as Europeans must act decisively and effectively,” said Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou.

There are plans to force more than 90 European banks to raise one billion euros in extra capital to support Greece, which can't pay its debts and needs a write-off of at least 50%.

Germany will spur the austerity plan, while another major concern is to boost the firepower of the bailout fund.

Part of the EFSF has already been directed to help Greece, Ireland and Portugal but the amount is expected to be leveraged fivefold to provide between 1.25 and 1.5 trillion euro.

On the other hand, France wants to turn the fund into a bank with unlimited credit from the European Central Bank.

To avoid that worst-case scenario, deepening the pockets of the bailout fund will be essential, says Carsten Brzeski, ING senior economist.

“It looks as if private investors will have to take a much higher loss.

We hear numbers now between 50 and 60 per cent, which I think would be painful for many investors,” he says.

At the same time, Germany has a winning plan to use the existing fund as a type of insurance mechanism that could guarantee future losses of up to 20 per cent on newly-issued bonds.

Any positive news is expected to re-establish confidence and push the euro higher.

However if no decisive steps are made, the risk of a global slump will remain very much on the cards.

Another EU leaders’ summit has kicked off in Brussels aimed at taking concrete steps to deal with the Eurozone debt crisis.

Ahead of that, German legislators agreed to support a massive expansion of the European bailout fund.

In one of the first decisions to emerge from the summit, big European banks will be required to raise their capital cushions to 9 percent of their risky investments.

The recommendation to banks exposed to the unhealthy finances of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain is to be put in effect by June 2012, the Associated Press reported, citing Polish Finance Minister Jan Vincent-Rostowski.

Moreover, a draft statement obtained by Reuters suggests the EU’s bailout fund will be increased "several fold."

The EU finance ministers are to agree the details of the scale up no earlier than in November.

The enlargement of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) might be achieved via cooperation with the International Monetary Fund.

Wednesday’s summit, which was called after an earlier gathering on Monday failed to produce any concrete results , is still to focus on resolving Greece's debt crisis, scaling up the EU's bailout fund – and Italy's staggering finances.

"We need a deal tonight, and we need political agreement to the key aspects that are on the table," European Commission spokesman Olivier Bailly said in Brussels.

Still, the summit may not provide the final figure on writing down the Greek debt, he added.

But  before the meeting, German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated that private investors should  take a cut of at least 50 percent on Greek bonds.

Such a "haircut" would  imply for creditors a loss of 103 billion euros.

The  chancellor also said the summit should deliver a  solution, which will allow Greece to reduce its debt burden to 120  percent of GDP by 2020.

At the moment, there are fears that Greek debt  will continue mounting and may hit 190 percent of GDP in 2013.

Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is set to deliver a letter offering details  on the package of 54 billion euros ($75  billion) in austerity measures  adopted by Italy in September to balance  the country’s budget.

Less than 24 hours prior to the summit, PM Berlusconi managed to push through retirement  reform to knock the retirement age for all Italian workers from 65 up  to 67 by 2025. 

In Germany, the vote to enlarge the bailout fund of the European Financial    Stability Facility (EFSF) passed by a broad margin of 503 against 89    with four abstentions in the German Parliament.

Germany is the only    country where the Constitutional Court ruled that bail-out operations    involving taxpayers’ euros must first gain legislators’ approval.

Still,  this “massive vote in favor of fiscal sovereignty,” as Markus Kerber  described it, gives Merkel a mandate to begin negotiations in Brussels –  but not to conclude them.

“For the time being, Germany has neither said yes, nor said no” to  enlarging the bailout fund, said Kerber, a professor of political  economy at the Berlin Institute of Technology.

At present, the EFSF’s lending capacity is at 440 billion euros ($600 billion).

The boosting discussed by the EU leaders in Brussels would send the fund's lending capacity above 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion), but this has yet to be finalized.

According to the Associated Press, the EU summit will consider scaling up the EFSF by offering government-bond buyers insurance against possible losses and by attracting capital from private investors and sovereign wealth funds.

European banks agreed early on Thursday to write off 50 per cent of Greek debt.

The deal was reached during an emergency summit in Brussels overnight.

The EU and the IMF will also give the country another one hundred billion euros in rescue loans.

An agreement on expanding the bailout fund to one trillion euros followed immense pressure on EU leaders after multiple delays in anti-crisis action.

Athens will be handed a new €100bn bailout package in early 2012.

“The Eurozone stands ready to provide additional program financing of up to €100 billion until 2014, including the required recapitalization of Greek banks,” the official communiqué reads.

As the write-off falls this time on the shoulders of private investors, the agreement guarantees them a €30 billion sweetener in exchange for the deal which will come partly from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and partly from money made by the Greek government on attempts to privatize its state assets.

“We have a voluntary agreement with the private sector, the parameters of which we have discussed with their representatives.

As France has been asking from the beginning, we have excluded the possibility of a default of Greece.

The private sector has written off half of the debt that it holds,” French President Nicolas Sarkozy told journalists after the summit.

The new debt reduction measures will bring Greece's debt down to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020, experts say. 

Greek banks are estimated to have the biggest capital holes on their balance sheets, Euroactiv.com wrote on Thursday.

Figures from Morgan Stanley estimate that Greek banks would require over €80 billion in handouts, while Spain, Italy, France and Germany require up to €30 billion between them.

EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in his turn described the agreement as “a very solid way forward,” adding that the EU’s fight against a default in Greece is more a marathon than a sprint, meaning the effect of the measures will only become apparent in a long-term perspective.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed confidence that the measures agreed would solve the crisis.  

“I do believe that we were able to live up to expectations, that we did the right thing for the Eurozone, and this brings us one step further along the road towards a good and sensible solution,” Merkel stated after the deal was reached.

However, not everyone thinks showering Greece with fresh cash will remedy the crisis.

“The money we have spent on Greece is lost money.

I have said this since spring 2010.

We should have kept Greece out of the Eurozone”, Markus Kerber, a professor of political economy at the Berlin Institute of Technology, told RT.

­Greece to nationalize some banks

­The Greek government is going to put some banks in the country under state control as part of a move to  increase the capitalization of the Eurozone’s financial institutions, the Greek PM announced on Thursday.

“A number of banks will be partially nationalized.

After the planned restructuring is done, we’ll open them back to the market,” George Papandreou was quoted as saying by Bloomberg news agency.

The banks in question were not named and no further details of the planned share exchange were given.

“After the deal is done, the situation with the Greek financial institutions will be clarified, and the banks will become viable and risk-protected,” Papandreou added.

BERLIN:

German Chancellor Angel Merkel won a parliamentary vote with a large majority on Wednesday on boosting the firepower of the euro zone rescue fund, handing her a strong mandate to negotiate at a crunch EU summit later in the day in Brussels.

The vice-president of the Bundestag lower house of parliament said 503 lawmakers had voted in favour of the motion, 89 against and there were four abstentions.

The parliamentary vote binds Merkel to sticking closely to the text of the motion passed by the Bundestag in her negotiations in Brussels, thus strengthening her bargaining power.

EU leaders will meet to try to agree on a range of measures to tackle the spiralling euro zone debt crisis, but the prospects of a comprehensive deal looked dim with disagreements remaining in several crucial areas.

Addressing parliament before the vote, Merkel urged lawmakers to live up to their "historic duty" and said Europe was in its toughest period since the end of World War II. "The world is watching Germany and Europe to see if we are ready and able to take responsibility.

If the euro fails, Europe fails," said Merkel . Supported by the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens, Merkel won the vote easily but it was unclear initially whether she had to rely on the opposition to get the vote through.

Several rebels from within her own centre-right coalition had said they would vote against the motion, highlighting the struggle Merkel faces in convincing Germans of the need for Europe's biggest economy to help its indebted partners.

Merkel is battling sliding ratings for herself and her centre-right coalition over her handling of the euro zone crisis.

Critics at home and abroad have accused her of taking a dithering approach that has exacerbated the debt crisis, and frustration is rife.

Europe's crisis the butt of jokes

Euro zone leaders struck a last-minute deal last night to contain the currency bloc's two-year-old debt crisis but are now under pressure to finalise the details of their plan to slash Greece's debt burden and strengthen their rescue fund.

After a summit in Brussels, governments announced an agreement under which private banks and insurers would accept 50% losses on their Greek debt holdings in the latest bid to cut Athens' 360 billion euro debt load to sustainable levels.

Economists polled by Reuters today were split down the middle over whether the writedown was big enough, with 24 of 47 saying it was not and the remainder saying it was.

Martin Allison, of Craigs Investment Partners, told TVNZ's business programme today that fundamentally, the deal is about the European Union bailing out its banks.

"If Greece was to default, if Italy was to get into further trouble, its the banking system that comes under huge pressure," he explained on AMP Business.

"The EU has said we will underwrite the banks when it comes down to it, so the banking system is intact."

The deal has sparked a rally in global stocks that is likely to be repeated when New Zealand's exchange opens at 10am.

Allison says markets have been "absolutely hammered" throughout this long drawn-out crisis and this is partially a relief rally.

"The Europeans take their time, they do it in the most painfully slow way you can imagine but they will get there," he said.

The deal process

Reached after more than eight hours of hard-nosed negotiations between bankers, heads of state and the IMF, the deal foresees a recapitalisation of hard-hit European banks and a leveraging of the bloc's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), to give it firepower of 1.0 trillion euros ($US1.4 trillion).

US stocks surged more than 2% in early trade and European shares climbed 4% to a 12-week high on the deal.

They were led higher by banks which raced up over 9%, with BNP , Societe Generale and Credit Agricole of France leading the way.

The euro shot above $US1.41 to reach its top level against the dollar in seven weeks.

But key aspects of the deal, including the mechanics of boosting the EFSF and providing Greek debt relief, could take weeks or even months to pin down, raising the risk of the plan unravelling as the last one did.

"I see the main risk is that we are left waiting too long again for the implementation of these agreements," European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny said.

"Speed is very important here," he told national broadcaster ORF.

Three months ago, euro zone leaders unveiled another agreement that was meant to draw a line under the debt woes that threaten to tear apart the 12-year old currency bloc.

In a matter of weeks they realised it was inadequate given the depth of Greece's economic problems and the vulnerability of European banks.

The new deal aims to address these holes.

"Absolutely sustainable"

Under it, the private sector agreed to voluntarily accept a nominal 50% cut in its bond investments to reduce Greece's debt burden by 100 billion euros, cutting its debts to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020, from 160% now.

The euro zone will offer 30 billion euros in "credit enhancements" or sweeteners to the private sector to get them on board.

The aim is to complete negotiations on the package by the end of the year, so Greece has a full, second financial aid programme in place before 2012.

The value of that package, EU sources said, would be 130 billion euros -- up from 109 billion euros in the July deal.

"The debt is absolutely sustainable now," Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said.

A top lawyer for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said that because banks had agreed to accept the losses, the deal was unlikely to trigger a "credit event" under which credit default swaps (CDS), or default insurance contracts, would have to be paid out.

In a bid to convince markets that they can prevent larger countries like Italy and Spain from being swept up by the crisis, euro zone leaders also agreed to scale up the EFSF, the 440 billion euro bailout fund they created in May 2010 and have already used to provide aid to Ireland, Portugal and Greece.

Around 250 billion euros remaining in the fund will be leveraged 4-5 times, producing a headline figure of around 1.0 trillion euros.

The EFSF will be leveraged in two ways, either by offering insurance, or first-loss guarantees, to purchasers of euro zone debt in the primary market, or via a special purpose investment vehicle that will be set up in the coming weeks and which is aimed at attracting investment from China and Brazil.

The methods could be combined, giving the EFSF greater flexibility, the euro zone leaders said.

But EU finance ministers are not expected to agree on the nitty-gritty elements of how the scaled up EFSF will work until some time in November, with the exact date not fixed.

Another question mark is Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's commitment to implementing reforms seen as crucial for restoring confidence in the bloc's third largest economy.

Dogged by scandals, Berlusconi has promised to raise the retirement age to 67 by 2026 and attempt other reforms, but the EU is reserving judgement after repeated backsliding from Rome in recent months.

G20

Dubbed as a "haircut", the huge cuts off the Greek debt would trigger hundreds and thousands of credit default swaps, essentially bond insurance, that would in turn expose European banks to pay back billions as a part of the deal when a bond isn't paid back in full.

Merkel Appeal

German Chancellor, Angel Merkel, making an appeal to the Bundestag said the:

"Greek debt management must be improved and steps needed to be taken to understand it better."

"I am aware that there is some risk, and I understand that all 27 EU states needed to agree, but I think Europe needs to be ready for changes and need to hear changes," she said.

"We must not forget that the crisis came about from a lack of regulation, but the summit and the G20 is an opportunity to change this."

Financial Markets Need "Detail"

A leading independent financial body, which monitors markets behaviour, says the only way to avert another crisis as soon as morning is in a detailed plan and not to make this "grand gestures" all of the time.

"We have heard these statements being made time and time again, but where are the figures?

The fact that the 27 EU financial ministers aren't sitting around the table today shows there probably won't be the kind of detail the financial markets need to satisfy their needs."

Aside from the investors' haircut, the summit will be deciding for a new mandatory buffer that banks must have and also to decide on the amount needed to recapitalise the banks most exposed by the Greek and Italian debts.

BRUSSELS | Wed Oct 26, 2011 5:53pm BST

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders were holding talks on Wednesday to try to agree on a convincing, comprehensive plan for tackling the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.

The Brussels meeting of EU leaders will be followed by a summit for the 17-nation single currency area, whose leaders have struggled to hammer out a plan.

Following are comments ahead of Wednesday's talks:

IRISH PRIME MINISTER ENDA KENNY

"I understand there has been some progress made in a number of areas, but clearly leaders of the euro zone will have their own individual points to put up here.

As I said, the important thing here that the fully flexibility of the facilities that were approved be used now to bring certainty, and certainty of intent, for everybody, from both the (European) Council and the euro zone in particular."

AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR WERNER FAYMANN

ON HAIRCUT FOR GREEK BONDHOLDERS:

"The wish is to come up with a voluntary haircut, I think that is right, but until that is negotiated we can't announce it. It's still open."

"We always said 40-50 percent is part of the negotiations but we have to be fair because we don't know what the counterparties would ask for that."

ON EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY (EFSF):

"The other issue is to improve the way the rescue fund is used.

To make it strong enough that it would last for a few months or years would be an elementary step forward.

If we always have to call summits against the background of a crisis it doesn't create a lot of trust.

"I'm very much in favour of making better use of the rescue fund and giving it more bearing capacity."

DUTCH PRIME MINISTER MARK RUTTE

"We need a real solution, we won't buy anything with mediocre compromises.

Some things really need to happen.

"We need today to talk about Greece and ensure that Greek debt is sustainable and that we're finally finished with this business.

We must talk about the banks and how they get through this difficult phase.

"We must ensure that this bazooka, the European rescue fund, is strong enough to show the market that we mean it. We also have to make sure this can't happen in the future.

We need strong supervision and live up to our promises."

"We are in this job to take decisions.

It's not easy, but it really has to happen."

BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER YVES LETERME

"I think we will have a solution for Greece.

It is very important to ask for a voluntary effort by the banks to reduce Greece's debt.

It is also an effort through the EFSF to make credit accessible at reasonable rates for Greece."

ON WORK AHEAD:

"I think it is work that advances step-by-step.

But the step we are going to take today or tonight is a very important step towards a total restoration of the confidence in the euro zone."

"It's an economic union in the making so it does not yet have the firepower it should have, but we're taking steps forward.

Let's hope for tonight."

ON EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY (EFSF) BAILOUT

FUND:

"Let's hope we succeed in giving (the EFSF) enough convincing firepower.

It's one of the two to three most important points we still have to tackle."

"I think that in effect we would need to be a whole bit above 1,000 billion euros.

(869 billion pounds)"

GREEK PRIME MINISTER GEORGE PAPANDREOU

"Our challenge today is not simply to save the euro.

It is to safeguard the ideas we cherish so much in Europe:

Peace and cooperation amongst our nations, social cohesion and solidarity without prejudice amongst our people.

"From our side the Greek people are making a superhuman effort to put our house in order, to make our economy confident, viable, prosperous and create a better future for the Greek people, for our country.

"Now is the time for the European leadership to collectively take decisions to end the uncertainty, end the crisis, turn the page and make sure we make a big step forward for the better future and prosperity and security of our peoples in Europe."

EUROGROUP PRESIDENT AND LUXEMBOURG'S PRIME MINISTER

JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER

ON ITALY:

"Our Italian friends know well that we have to assume that we will be informed this evening that there will be significant, structural (budget) consolidation efforts from Italy.

That is a must."

ON AGREEING DECISIONS:

"I think that if we make our decisions in such a way that they work under pressure, then we will have made the right decisions."

BRUSSELS | Thu Oct 27, 2011 4:39am BST

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone leaders said on Thursday they had reached agreement on a comprehensive package of measures to tackle the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.

The leaders said private holders of Greek debt would accept a 50 percent writedown on their holdings as part of a scheme to reduce the country's debt burden.

And the euro zone heads of state and government also agreed on the need to recapitalise European banks and to increase the firepower of the euro zone bailout fund, the EFSF, to about one trillion euros.

Following are comments from leaders after the talks:

GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL ON GREEK DEBT:

"Our goal is that the debt of Greece by 2020 is 120 percent (of GDP)."

"A nominal haircut of 50 percent has been agreed.

On the basis of this, we will have a new programme for Greece with a value of 100 billion euros."

"There will be a reinforced monitoring regime in connection with the fulfilment of the Greek obligations."

"That will be anchored in a memorandum of understanding.

There will be a permanent presence there.

It will be possible to monitor the measures taken by Greece.

I think that this is better than when every three months a 'troika' travels there and back, a permanent system of supervision."

ON THE EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY:

"We know that the optimisation of the EFSF is necessary ... in connection with avoiding any contagion effect.

The ECB is not involved.

"We have agreed that by the end of November the... framework... will be worked out by the finance ministers.

It is important that through these two options we maximise the effectiveness of the EFSF, that we have a leverage of four to five times.

"It is very difficult, without having ever used the instruments, to say what this really means.

We believe we will have a lot of flexibility to protect the euro and avoid contagion risks.

We say that we can achieve around about 1 trillion euros."

EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUEL BARROSO ON THE ROLE OF BANKS IN ENDING THE CRISIS:

"Our goal is to ensure banks maintain lending to the real economy.

"Tonight's conclusions also make clear that banks should be subject to constraints regarding the distribution of dividends and bonus payments until recapitalisation is complete.

"The technical work needed to finalise certain aspects of this package will be completed by the relevant authorities in the coming weeks."

ON SITUATION IN ITALY:

"There are here several measures and commitments.

And there is afterwards a task given to the (European) Commission and to the Italian authorities to provide all of the necessary data for the implementation.

"So the key is implementation.

This is the key. It is not enough to make commitments, it is necessary now to check if they are really implementing."

OUTGOING EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET ASKED IF HE THOUGHT THE DECISIONS ARE ENOUGH TO STEM THE CRISIS:

"I think they have to be fully implemented... as rapidly and effectively as possible.

And I have only to say that what counts is the level of confidence.

"What I heard in this European Council was the expression of the will of the heads (of state and government).

That is in my opinion extremely important.

What is backing this orientation is the will, the collegial will, if I may, of the heads of state and government that are behind.

"But again no complacency -- very hard work, very hard work."

FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY

"The summit allowed us to adopt the components of a global response, of an ambitious response, of a credible response to the crisis that is sweeping across the euro zone."

EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY ON COOPERATION IN EUROPE:

"Compared to eight or 10 years ago, the pressure which leaders put on each other has become much more effective, as the events of the last days show.

Today no government can afford to underestimate the possible impact of for instance public debts or housing bubbles in another euro zone country on its own economy;

they would be punished by the voters, and by the markets.

Peer pressure has become more effective, because the money of their taxpayers is at stake."

ON ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (ECB) AND INCOMING ECB PRESIDENT MARIO DRAGHI:

"If the current president or the upcoming president are saying that they will intervene until the new mechanism is really put into place, it is up to them to decide.

So we are not interfering in this, we are not asking for it. We take note of the declarations made recently by Mr Draghi but we have no demands and nothing to request."

ON GREECE:

"We want to put Greece on track, where in 2020 it will have reduced its public debt to 120 percent of GDP. Since July, market conditions have worsened.

The new plan includes additional effort by the state sector.

"It also includes a voluntary contribution by private creditors who have lent to Greece.

It was agreed by them tonight and amounts to nominal discount of 50 percent of notional Greek debt."

ON EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY (EFSF):

"A sufficient firewall against contagion -- thanks to an agreement to multiply to up five-fold the firepower of the EFSF.

The leverage could be up to one trillion (euros) under certain assumptions about market conditions and investors' responsiveness in view of economic policies.

"We have identified two approaches for the EFSF.

The first one aims at getting credit enhancement to sovereign bonds issued by member states.

Under the second approach, the fund could set up one or several (special purpose vehicles) SPVs to finance its operations.

Each option could lead to leverage of up to four to five times.

They can be used simultaneously so as to increase the robustness of the financial strategy."

"We are all aware the situation is serious.

The situation was evolving into a systemic concern.

This threat has to be contained."

IRISH PRIME MINISTER ENDA KENNY ON BANK RECAPITALISATION:

"In respect of recapitalisation of the European banks this has been achieved without any damage to Irish interests."

ON IRISH SITUATION:

"The communication is very clear that this is a unique and individual situation for Greece and clearly there is the continued funding for Ireland.

This is well recognised and specifically presented by the leaders."

Following are comments from EU leaders earlier:

POLISH PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK  ON EU INTEGRATION:

"I had the impression all partners understand that we need enhanced integration, not only at the level of the Eurogroup but at the level of the whole European Union."

ON BANK CAPITAL QUALITY:

"The key issue was the issue of high quality capital, the 9 percent ratio that was adopted that we need to maintain this ratio.

And we also adopted certain elements of the way we should proceed to attain this goal.

An emotional element during this debate, was the fact of making this exceptional circumstance and not permanent element... so this will not be a permanent solution for the future."

ON AGREEING A PACKAGE OF MEASURES:

"The banking element is part of a broader package... All participants were fully aware that the draft annex to this statement concerning the recapitalisation of banks will work only when the euro area approves other elements that are currently being debated.

"Bank recapitalisation without the remaining elements, such as the so-called firewall... wouldn't have any chance of success.

So the statement today is a pre-condition and it's really an introduction for looking for further elements in the euro area with greater comfort."

ON POLITICAL AGREEMENT:

"Bank recapitalisation is an issue concerning all member states.

This project cannot be seen in isolation and independently of the other elements.

My impression is that all 27 accept the idea of bank recapitalisation in this statement.

"If you are asking whether we are expecting that all decisions will be taken today during the euro area meeting I would be very cautious to make such a statement.

"I think we are very close to a full political agreement, however there are some important details that might perhaps require more time.

"It is important, however, that tonight the euro area should demonstrate that a political agreement has been achieved and the only things that remain are important, but only technical issues."

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON

"We made good progress tonight.

It is very much in Britain's interest that we sort out these problems and solve this crisis.

"We made good progress on the bank recapitalisation.

That wasn't watered down, it has now been agreed.

It will only go ahead when the other parts of a full package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight."

Following are comments from earlier, ahead of the EU leaders' meeting:

IRISH PRIME MINISTER ENDA KENNY

"I understand there has been some progress made in a number of areas, but clearly leaders of the euro zone will have their own individual points to put up here.

Angela Merkel [right]arrived in Brussels after securing backing from the German parliament

EU leaders are gathering for an emergency summit in Brussels aimed at tackling the eurozone debt crisis.

But with disagreement on how to expand the EU's bailout fund for debt-ridden countries, there is growing doubt a comprehensive deal will be reached.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, after winning support from her parliament for moves to boost the fund, said there remained "many problems to settle".

There are fears that the Greek debt crisis could spread to Italy and Spain.

Ahead of Wednesday's parliamentary vote in Berlin, Chancellor Merkel said it was worth taking the risk to maximise the bailout fund's spending power in order to safeguard Germany's future prosperity.

"The world is watching Germany and Europe," she said.

"They are looking to see if we are ready and able to assume our responsibilities during Europe's worst crisis since the end of World War II."

Later, as she arrived in Brussels, she told reporters:

"There are still many problems to settle and negotiations to carry out."

As attention shifts to Italy and its huge public debt, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been asked to provide his EU colleagues in Brussels with details of plans for economic reforms.

Sticking points

Among the main points of agreement reportedly reached at the weekend by EU officials are:

* European banks must raise more than 100bn euros (£87bn) in new capital to shield them against possible losses to indebted countries

* The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - the single currency's 440bn-euro bailout fund - will be given more firepower, although it is not clear how this will be achieved

* Lenders to Greece will be asked to agree to much deeper losses than the 21% write-off currently on the table.

According to the plan, the 100bn-euro bank recapitalisation would be provided to banks by commercial investors, national governments and the EFSF.

Key points of disagreement remain between the main eurozone powers.

France had hoped that the European Central Bank (ECB) would support the EFSF by providing it with loans that could increase the fund's total capacity to 2tn-3tn euros.

But this idea was blocked by Chancellor Merkel.

Instead, governments are expected to agree that the EFSF can help out troubled eurozone governments such as Italy and Spain by providing partial guarantees to investors and banks who lend them more money.

Stopgap

BBC business editor Robert Peston says the EU is left with using complicated financial engineering that may only boost the EFSF capacity to about 1tn euros.

He says the markets may be disappointed in this move, which may only buy a year or so - not enough time for fundamental reform of Europe's debt-ridden economies.

There was also disagreement over the extent of losses that should be imposed on Greece's lenders, with Germany seeking a 50%-60% haircut.

The ECB is said to be against such an increase in potential losses.

And difficulty about such details appear to have been behind a decision to cancel a meeting of EU finance ministers which was to have preceded the leaders' summit.

French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said that if Wednesday's summit ended in failure, "this could tip the European continent into unknown territory".

Mr Berlusconi is expected to provide only promises of economic reforms in Italy, even though other eurozone leaders have demanded he bring concrete plans to Brussels of how the government intends to reduce its debt.

In a long day of talks with his Northern League coalition partner, an agreement was reached on the contentious issue of raising the retirement age to 67 by 2025.

The BBC's David Willey in Rome says there is little ground for optimism that the deal is going to satisfy either Italy's EU partners or international financial markets about the country's ability to repay its long-term debts.

EU leaders to meet Wednesday over sovereign debt crisis

Mike Eppel Oct 26, 2011 07:34:29 AM

European Union leaders are gathering for another summit, Wednesday, on the sovereign debt crisis.

The latest one is taking place in Brussels, Belgium.

It's the 14th meeting in 21 months and again, as there's diminished expectations for an all-encompassing deal.

Despite warnings from the market that they're running out of time to solve the debt crisis and avoid defaults in Greece and possibly other indebted nations, officials have been lowering expectations of a breakthrough agreement.

That's despite assurances from France and Germany, only weeks ago, that a "comprehensive solution" to more than two years of debt and economic turmoil would be found by the end of October.

What may come out of the meeting is a more consistent road map to a final agreement, focus on the Greek debt write down, bank recapitalization plan and European sovereign debt rescue fund, which may be expanded to over $1-trillion (U.S.).

Map:

Belgium

Big banks will be forced to take a 50 per cent haircut on their Greek bond holdings and the eurozone bailout fund will be leveraged up to 1 trillion euros under deals thrashed out by the continent's leaders during all-night talks in Brussels.

An earlier statement by EU leaders after a first round of talks this morning said agreement had been reached to bolster the region's banks and force them to meet higher standards of financial strength.

But the final deals came after 10 hours of talks at a summit that began at 4:00pm local time and lasted until the following morning, aimed at finalising plans to contain Europe's two-year debt crisis and ease fears of a global recession.

"The summit allowed us to adopt the components of a global response, of an ambitious response, of a credible response to the crisis that is sweeping across the eurozone," French president Nicolas Sarkozy said as he announced the measures.

EU leaders have agreed to leverage the bailout fund - known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - by four to five times its value to 1 trillion euros ($1.33 trillion) in order to assist heavily indebted nations such as Italy.

European Council president Herman Van Rompuy said the deal included two measures to boost the "firepower" of the EFSF.

"The first one aims at getting credit enhancement to sovereign bonds issued by member states," he said.

"Under the second approach, the fund could set up one or several special-purpose vehicles to finance its operations.

"Each option could lead to leverage of up to four to five times.

They can be used simultaneously so as to increase the robustness of the financial strategy."

EU finance ministers would finalise the framework of that agreement by the end of November.

But German chancellor Angela Merkel sounded a word of caution on the deal.

"It is very difficult, without having ever used the instruments, to say what this really means," Ms Merkel said.

"We believe we will have a lot of flexibility to protect the euro and avoid contagion risks."

Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan welcomed the "important steps" taken by European leaders, but said more must be done to clarify the plan.

"We call on European leaders to finalise their plan and take swift action to implement it, so as to restore confidence in global markets and build growth in Europe," Mr Swan said.

Greek rescue

Meanwhile, banks have agreed to a voluntary 50 per cent write-down of Greece's 350 billion euro ($466 billion) debt, Mr Sarkozy said.

The deal will allow Greece to reduce its debt by 100 billion euros ($133 billion), he added.

Banks had recently accepted a 21 per cent write-down as part of a second bailout for Greece agreed at a summit in July, but Greece's economic situation deteriorated since that deal.

International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde said she was "encouraged" by the substantial progress made on each front of the three-pronged deal.

"The agreement reached on a coordinated mechanism to recapitalise banks and strengthen their funding is a major step forward," Ms Lagarde said.

"Restoring growth depends on a financially sound banking sector and reinforcing the banks' capital buffers is key."

European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso also welcomed the outcome but said more work must be done.

"The package we have agreed tonight is a comprehensive package and confirms that Europe will do what it takes to safeguard financial stability," he said.

"I've said it before and I'll say it again - this is a marathon, not a sprint."

The EFSF has already been used to rescue Portugal and Ireland, but it would have been insufficient to rescue Italy and Spain, the eurozone's third and fourth largest economies.

EU leaders have pressured embattled Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to present measures to slash Italy's $2.5 trillion debt and introduce structural reforms including raising its retirement age.

Mr Berlusconi presented a letter to the summit outlining plans to tackle the massive debts by November 15.

Mr Van Rompuy said at the close of the summit that EU leaders "welcomed the clear commitment of Italy to achieve these objectives and abide by the time it set itself".

'Iatrogenesis," derived from a Greek word, describes how a patient's condition can worsen because of complications from prior medical treatment.

And iatrogenesis is precisely what the European Union is experiencing because of its leaders' unwillingness to face reality in confronting Greece's sustained, reckless fiscal policies.

EU leaders are now struggling to hammer out yet another short-term, Rube-Goldberg-like deal to prevent their finances and even governments from collapsing.

But how can continuing to spread the risks and costs of mismanagement in Greece and other EU member states work long-term?

This ongoing turmoil over EU finances is directly traceable to basic flaws underlying “the European project."

Not only is the common currency, the euro, flawed conceptually and structurally, but the larger political dream to make “Europe" an alternative “pole" to the United States internationally was mistaken from the outset.

What should be America's role in these EU efforts?

Limited, at best.

Europe's political leaders have tried to make EU headquarters in Brussels into the centralized government an alternative pole requires, but average citizens of EU members have never seen this as a critical objective.

If anything, voters in nation after nation (not just longtime skeptics in Great Britain) have grown ever more dubious.

Each effort by European centralizers to overcome the flaws in their design only enhances the concern that EU leaders are making decisions with little or no democratic legitimacy.

The EU's awkward compromises invariably create cumbersome, inadequate institutions, further antagonizing average Europeans.

The current euro crisis has brought this repeated confrontation--between leaders with global pretensions and citizens who just want their politicians to be democratically responsive--to epic proportions.

EU decision-making about the euro's travails seems complex and arcane to outsiders, but the basic problem is simple.

Greece's inability to repay its debts underscores that several other EU members (Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Italy) have also pursued extravagant fiscal policies.

Thus, if Greece defaults, the inevitable crisis of confidence could trigger defaults throughout the Eurozone, endangering the entire continent's economy.

Instead of recognizing that a Greek default is the only responsible way to deal with irresponsible behavior, Europe's leaders have tried for almost two years to avoid the inevitable.

Instead, they've sought to marshal funds from any available source to lend to Greece, thus enabling it to repay its near-term obligations.

To avoid future problems caused by the debt being piled on Athens, Greece must undertake painful austerity measures, which, applied less drastically years ago, could have avoided today's crisis.

Unfortunately, there's not enough existing money to shore up Greece and other potential defaulters, so EU politicians are telling private banks to take a “haircut," perhaps losing 60 percent of the money Greece owes them.

This, of course, is a default by any sensible definition.

If private banks are browbeaten into accepting such big losses, it means the sovereign debt they carry on their books at face value is actually worth much less.

Thus, the banks' underlying capitalization is now at risk;

they are way overleveraged, requiring either new capital or substantial deleveraging to return to financial soundness.

Of course, there isn't enough money to do that, either, so EU leaders have tried to create sources of money, first using the EU central bank, then creating a “financial stability fund"--and now creating a “special-purpose vehicle" to be a “firewall" against future defaults.

Why should anyone believe them?

Why should private investors rely on the “insurance" the new facility will provide, and why should they sink funds into the new vehicle?

When this third vehicle comes unstuck, as is almost inevitable, will the Europeans create a fourth institution to save the earlier, failed ones?

This is the definition of iatrogenesis.

What should be America's role in these EU efforts?

Limited, at best.

We should obviously be concerned about the effect on US financial institutions and economy of massive failure in Europe, and we're entitled to take precautionary measures.

To date, our involvement has been mostly indirect, via International Monetary Fund financing--and opposition in Congress even to such indirect assistance is rising, and properly so.

Much of the EU project is an effort to create a global alternative to the United States.

The Europeans are certainly entitled to try, but they're not entitled to our assistance when they fail, as they're in the process of doing.

Trying to rescue the European Union's failed political objectives should be off the table in Washington.

(AGI) Brussels - Prior the summit of government leaders on the Eurozone crisis, PM Silvio Berlusconi has met with EU heads.

  The meeting with Jose' Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy lasted a quarter of an hour and the contents of the letter from the Italian government to be presented during the meeting of Eurozone leaders was discussed.

The Eurozone meeting will begin after summit of the 27. .      .

European leaders are holding crucial talks in Brussels in a bid to finally craft a solution to the two-year-old eurozone debt crisis, which analysts say threatens the economic stability of the entire region.

 

European leaders remained deeply divided ahead of Wednesday's summit but an initial meeting involving officials from all 27 European Union member states made progress on plans to recapitalise the continent's banks, according to David Cameron, the British prime minister.

 

"We made good progress tonight.

It is very much in Britain's interest that we sort out these problems and solve this crisis," Cameron said.

 

"We made good progress on the bank recapitalisation.

That wasn't watered down, it has now been agreed.

It will only go ahead when the other parts of a full package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight."

 

Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons reports from Athens

on the eurozone debt crisis

Jan Vincent-Rostowski, the Polish finance minister, said big European banks will be required to raise their capital cushions to nine per cent of their risky investments by June.

 

Eurozone leaders - the 17 states which use the euro single currency - are now meeting to discuss other proposals to stem the crisis, including greater powers and resources for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) bailout fund and writing off some of Greece's debts.

 

However, difference of opinion among the eurozone leaders has made it difficult to reach an agreement.

 

Germany wants Greek private debt holders to bear losses, while France, the European Commission and the European Central Bank insist that any debt relief has to remain voluntary.

Earlier in the day, Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, received a boost ahead of the summit when the German parliament voted in favour of plans to boost the EFSF, the $600bn mechanism set up to provide support to eurozone economies at risk of defaulting on debts

"The world is watching Germany and Europe to see if we are ready and able to take responsibility.

If the euro fails, Europe fails," said Merkel ahead of the vote.

Merkel has called for a 50 per cent write-down of Greek debt held by private sector companies including many European banks; far more than the 21 per cent loss agreed to by the private sector in July.

'Structural reforms'

"We will do all we can to get Greece back on its feet as soon as possible," she said, adding:

"A debt write-down alone will not solve Greece's problems ... structural reforms must still be implemented."

Greece, the region's most troubled nation with debts of $484bn, has already implemented unpopular austerity cuts to access bailout funds from the EU and the IMF, but there are fears the crisis could spread to larger economies within the eurozone including Italy and Spain.

As the eurozone's biggest economy, any eventual deal will likely require Germany's backing.

But Merkel needed to win Wednesday's vote to give her a mandate to negotiate a deal with other EU leaders aimed at delivering a range of measures to stop the debt crisis from spiralling.

Europe has already bailed out three small eurozone members - Greece, Portugal and Ireland - and there are fears it cannot afford to bail out the troubled economies of Italy and Spain, the third and fourth largest economies in the bloc.

Yves Leterme, the Belgian prime minister, said EFSF would need resources of more than one trillion euro ($1.4tn) to prevent the currency union's debt crisis from spreading.

"I think that effectively, it has to be able to intervene a good deal beyond one trillion euro," he said before the summit.

Blunt message

Greece has been pushed out of the limelight in recent days by Italy, which is under intense pressure to implement promised austerity and growth measures.

Italian politicians exchanged blows in parliament as country faced heightened economic woes [Reuters]

In unusually blunt terms, French, German and EU leaders told Silvio Berlusconi , Italy's prime minister, to follow up on his reform commitments by Wednesday, in order to reassure markets.

The Italian prime minister has averted a government collapse to clinch an overnight deal on emergency growth measures demanded by the EU.

But there were scuffles in the Italian parliament as politicians came to blows over the tough economic reform programme.

Wednesday's summit comes just over one week before European leaders have to face their G-20 counterparts in Cannes, France.

China and the US have warned European leaders of the urgency to solve the debt crisis amid concerns that failure could push the world into another recession.

BRUSSELS --  NATO will wrap up its operations in Libya on October 31, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said in Brussels.

(Beta, file)

Pointing out that the United Defender operation in Libya was “one of the most successful ones” in NATO history, Rasmussen confirmed that it would be wrapped up on October 31.

“We have completely fulfilled the historic mandate we got from the UN to protect the Libyan people, establish a no-fly zone and an arms embargo,” it was said in the release.

"If necessary we will continue to respond to threats against civil society,” Rasmussen stressed.

The NATO secretary general made the statement only a day after the UN Security Council had adopted a resolution that will end NATO’s operation in Libya on October 31.

There were some speculations earlier that NATO could, at Libyan transitional government’s request, extend its presence in the country until the situation fully stabilized.

Rasmussen especially thanked officers and soldiers who took part in the intervention in Libya.

“This is their victory,” he stressed.

Welcome to AFP's live coverage of events in Brussels, where European leaders are holding a crucial summit on the eurozone debt crisis.

With an hour to go before the summit opens, we'll bring you live updates from Brussels and reaction from around the world.

Here's a summary of key recent developments:

- Hopes are dimming that the gathering of European presidents and prime ministers will come up with a watertight deal to ward off fears of global recession.

- Draft conclusions leaked ahead of the talks show no deal on a figure for recapitalisation needs of banks.

Finance ministers had given broad agreement to a 108-billion-euro ($150 billion) recapitalisation tab last week.

- Senior diplomats have warned that negotiations with banks on a big write-down of Greek debt are proceeding slowly and that plans to boost Europe's bailout fund remain unclear.

- But China has injected a note of hope that the eurozone may be able to beef up the fund -- which currently stands at 440 million euros -- to more than a trillion euros, which would enable it to rescue large economies such as Italy and Spain.

Top EU diplomats tell AFP that China has agreed to invest in the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), a clear signal that attempts to solve the eurozone crisis are truly global.

- Russia has also offered to help boost the size of the bailout fund by acting with other countries through the International Monetary Fund.

- Global powers, from the United States to Japan and China, have pressed European leaders for a lasting solution to the debt crisis, ahead of the G20 summit in France on November 3 and 4.

- The spotlight will be firmly on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was told by his peers after a first summit on Sunday to return to Brussels with proof of rapid action to cut a debt mountain six times the size of that in Greece.

- Italian media report that Berlusconi has brought a 15-page letter outlining plans for reforms -- including a last-minute agreement with his Northern League coalition partner to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 in 2026 -- with him to Brussels today.

It's a self-appointed deadline the eurozone can't afford to miss.

By the early hours of Thursday, we may finally discover how much firepower has been amassed to try to blast away the debt turmoil steadily spreading from Europe's financially wayward periphery to its core.

Few expect the final package reached at Brussels will quite be the "big bazooka" demanded by UK Prime Minister David Cameron.

Yet the nature of the deal that's finally agreed will show whether the partners - and Germany in particular - have the will and capability to hold the currency zone together.

We are about to witness what may go down in history as one of the most significant meetings in EU history.

Of all the myriad issues that need fixing.

the financial world expects clear responses on the three crucial issues of beefing up the rescue fund to protect Italy and Spain, reducing Greece's debt mountain and shoring up vulnerable banks that have lent to highly-indebted countries.

The deadline Europe cannot miss

A statement by EU leaders said banks should meet higher standards of financial strength but did not give a figure for how much extra they would have to raise.

It said the banks should try to raise the money privately - but if necessary, they would have to turn to public funds.

However key points of disagreement remain between the main eurozone powers.

France had hoped that the European Central Bank (ECB) would support the EFSF by providing it with loans that could increase the fund's total capacity to 2tn-3tn euros.

But this idea was blocked by Chancellor Merkel.

Instead, governments are expected to agree that the EFSF can help out troubled eurozone governments such as Italy and Spain by providing partial guarantees to investors and banks who lend them more money.

BBC business editor Robert Peston says the EU is left with using complicated financial engineering that may only boost the EFSF capacity to about 1tn euros.

He says the markets may be disappointed in this move, which may only buy a year or so - not enough time for fundamental reform of Europe's debt-ridden economies.

There was also disagreement over the extent of losses that should be imposed on Greece's lenders, with Germany seeking a 50%-60% haircut.

The ECB is said to be against such an increase in potential losses.

Mrs Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy are now negotiating directly with private sector bankers on the Greek debt.

And difficulty about such details appear to have been behind a decision to cancel a meeting of EU finance ministers which was to have preceded the leaders' summit.

Before flying to Brussels, Chancellor Merkel won a vote in the German parliament giving her a mandate to strengthen the EFSF.

Angela Merkel says ''we have to fight'' to resolve Europe's issues

She told MPs it was worth taking the risk to maximise the fund's spending power in order to safeguard Germany's future prosperity.

French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said that if Wednesday's summit ended in failure, "this could tip the European continent into unknown territory".

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was expected to provide only promises of economic reforms in Italy, even though other eurozone leaders have demanded he bring concrete plans to Brussels of how the government intends to reduce its debt.

Europe's four big dilemmas

European leaders have reached a "three-pronged" agreement described as vital to solve the region's huge debt crisis.

They said banks holding Greek debt accepted a 50% loss, the eurozone bailout fund will be boosted and banks will have to raise more capital.

Shares on European markets rose sharply on news of the deal.

The agreement is aimed at preventing the crisis spreading to larger eurozone economies like Italy, but the leaders said work still needed to be done.

After marathon talks in Brussels, they agreed a mechanism to boost the eurozone's main bailout fund to about 1tn euros (£880bn;

$1.4tn).

Banks must also raise more capital to protect them against losses resulting from any future government defaults.

BBC business editor Robert Peston says it is perfectly clear that EU leaders have bought some time, and for a few weeks and maybe longer the markets will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Analysis

Gavin Hewitt BBC Europe editor

The ambition is not in doubt but many crucial details are missing and the test of this deal lies in the weeks ahead.

Greece has been given a chance to escape its debt trap but long years of austerity lie ahead and its economy is still shrinking.

The 1tn-euro bailout fund will be lower than some people think necessary to protect big economies like Italy and Spain.

The test will be whether it lowers their borrowing costs.

With this deal some time has been bought.

Some of the crucial details of how, for instance, the rescue fund will work, will not be hammered out until November.

Hanging over all of this is the question of growth.

All of these calculations, commitments and expressions of determination can be dismissed if Europe's weakest countries do not return to growth.

Read Gavin's thoughts in full

The framework for the new fund is to be put in place in November.

Meanwhile EU leaders welcomed Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's pledge to balance his country's budgets and implement reforms to bring down its 1.9tn-euro debt.

Correspondents say Mr Berlusconi had been under huge pressure to prove he was serious about austerity measures.

'Ambitious response'

The announcement of the deal helped lift the euro, with investors reacting positively to the outlook for the region's growth and single currency.

"The eurozone has adopted a credible and ambitious response to the debt crisis," a visibly tired French President Nicolas Sarkozy said at a news conference early in the morning in the Belgian capital.

"Europe is closer to resolving its financial and economic crisis," said Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, in a report later to the European Parliament.

"We are showing that we can unite in the most difficult of times."

How much is a trillion?

A million seconds is 11.57 days

A billion seconds is 31.7 years

A trillion seconds is 31,709 years

Fears about the state of the eurozone's finances and the threat of a break-up of the single European currency have been stalking markets for months.

Critics have accused policymakers of not doing enough to resolve the issues, contributing further to problems and fuelling uncertainty.

Leaders of the 17 eurozone nations had been in meetings since Wednesday trying to hammer out a deal to help Greece put its national finances in order and underpin other European economies such as Italy.

Analysis:

Will the plan work?

Commentators predict the effect of the three-pronged deal.

The Independent's Hamish McRae says so far markets haven't reacted like "headless chickens".

He expects only a modest recession in Europe.

Allen Mattich at the Wall Street Journal calls it a "eurofudge" and predicts the plan will be a failure.

He sees the imbalances between the eurozone countries as so large that the euro will inevitably fail.

In the Financial Times Sir John Major agrees . He says he kept Britain out of the common currency because of the flaws in the euro - flaws the bailout doesn't get rid of.

Speaking after the deal was agreed, Mr Sarkozy said that "the complexity of the files, the necessity to get everybody to agree, means that we have been negotiating for long hours".

He said he believed the result would be a relief for "the whole world", which had been expecting a strong decision from the summit.

Because banks have agreed to shoulder losses on Greek bonds, the country's burden has been reduced, cutting its debt down to 120% of its gross domestic product by 2020.

'Marathon not sprint'

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou hailed the deal, saying:

"We can claim that a new day has come for Greece, and not only for Greece but also for Europe."

The eurozone leaders also said the firepower of the main euro bailout fund - known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would be boosted from the current 440bn euros to about 1tn euros.

Europe's four big dilemmas

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said Europe has moved closer to solving the eurozone debt crisis, as an agreement was reached in Brussels.

Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Barroso said the deal showed the EU could unite in the most difficult of times.

He also announced the appointment of a commissioner dedicated to the euro.

Shares on European markets rose sharply on news of the deal.

The framework for the new fund is to be put in place in November.

Euro lifted

"I am pleased to stand before you this morning and confirm that Europe is closer to resolving its financial and economic crisis and to getting back on a path of growth," Mr Barroso said.

"We are showing that we can unite in the most difficult of times."

He said the post of "super-commissioner" would be created to deal with the euro and give extra powers to the current EU Economic Commissioner, Ollie Rehn.

The leadership structure of a new framework for running the eurozone will rival the decision-making mechanism of the wider European Union, our business editor says, with the implication that the eurozone will more closely resemble a super-state.

The announcement of the deal helped lift the euro, with investors reacting positively to the outlook for the region's growth and single currency.

Fears about the state of the eurozone's finances and the threat of a break-up of the single European currency have been stalking markets for months.

The fragility of the eurozone member economies was underlined late on Thursday when French President Nicolas Sarkozy downgraded his forecast for French economic growth from 1.75% to 1% for next year.

He said the French government would have to find 6-8bn euros in supplementary budget savings and that decisions on this would be taken "within 10 days", after the next G20 summit on 3-4 November.

Critics have accused policymakers of not doing enough to resolve the issues, contributing further to problems and fuelling uncertainty.

Leaders of the 17 eurozone nations had been in meetings since Wednesday trying to hammer out a deal to help Greece put its national finances in order and underpin other European economies such as Italy.

Because banks have agreed to shoulder losses on Greek bonds, the country's burden has been reduced, cutting its debt down to 120% of its gross domestic product by 2020.

Analysis:

Will the plan work?

Commentators predict the effect of the three-pronged deal.

The Independent's Hamish McRae says so far markets have not reacted like "headless chickens".

He expects only a modest recession in Europe.

Allen Mattich at the Wall Street Journal calls it a "eurofudge" and predicts the plan will be a failure.

He sees the imbalances between the eurozone countries as so large that the euro will inevitably fail.

In the Financial Times, Sir John Major agrees . He says he kept Britain out of the common currency because of the flaws in the euro - flaws the bail-out doesn't get rid of.

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou hailed the deal, saying:

"We can claim that a new day has come for Greece, and not only for Greece but also for Europe."

The eurozone leaders also said the firepower of the main euro bailout fund - known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would be boosted from the current 440bn euros to about 1tn euros.

Bank recapitalisation - the third key element of the package - was agreed earlier.

The banks will now be required to raise about 106bn euros in new capital by June 2012, and governments may have to step in, despite the unpopularity of further bank bail-outs.

It is hoped that this will help shield the banks against losses resulting from any government defaults and protect larger economies - like Italy and Spain - from the market turmoil.

LONDON -          For those inclined to see the European Union as a hopeless contradiction in terms, the past year and a half has supplied more proof than they could possibly have imagined.

An endless series of emergency meetings, each supposedly the last, has generated little more than strategy pronouncements that are obsolete almost as soon as they're made.

Europe's leaders have struggled to unite behind a convincing counterattack against a debt crisis that endangers not just the regional but the global economy.

Their fumbling approach was on display again Wednesday as officials argued into the night to formulate the latest "grand plan" to wrestle the crisis under control.

This time, EU leaders assured the world, they would unveil a solution that would finally - finally - fix the mess.

Early Thursday, EU officials speaking on condition of anonymity, reportedly said a deal had been reached calling for banks to take losses of 50 percent on their Greek bonds, more than double the 21 percent agreed upon by the Eurozone and private bondholders in July.

It remained unclear how solid a plan will be in place by the time of next week's key Group of 20 meeting in Cannes, France, where countries including China and the United States had hoped to hear a report of major progress.

Investors also had expected clear answers from Wednesday's summit, the lack of which could throw markets into greater turmoil and cause the crisis to spread to major economies such as Spain and Italy.

The goal of finding a comprehensive solution by the self-imposed Wednesday deadline was hampered by more of the squabbling that has bedeviled the EU since the start of the crisis.

In the last few days, Italy bristled at criticism of its finances by Germany, which clashed over boosting the bailout fund with France, which blasted unwelcome meddling from Britain.

And nobody wanted any lectures from outsiders, particularly the U.S., which had warned starkly that time was running out for Europe to get its act together.

"It's complete chaos," said Marc Touati, an analyst for French investment group Assya.

"It is no longer cooperative, or even effective."

What's worse, he added, "is that we're used to it."

Patience for such disarray, however, may soon run out, as financial markets push up borrowing costs for Italy to close-to-unsustainable levels and the debt crisis moves from Europe's periphery and perilously close to its core.

In the weeks leading up to Wednesday's summit, many analysts and investors were heartened by what seemed like recognition at last by the Eurozone of the gravity of the crisis and the need for a "shock-and-awe" strategy to beat it back.

Leaders themselves began speaking of the talks as a make-or-break moment.

But a dispute between Germany and France, the Eurozone's dominant duo, over how best to bolster the bailout fund and how much to cut Greece's debt forced officials to drop their original plan to unveil a solution after talks on Sunday.

Then, on Wednesday, the new cutoff date, there was even more uncertainty.

Arriving in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel could tell reporters only that "everyone is traveling here today with the goal of getting a good way further."

At the same time, the government of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was on the verge of collapse over economic reforms demanded by fellow Eurozone nations.

A last-minute compromise with his coalition partners on pension reform and other issues allowed Berlusconi to show up for the summit with some promises in his pocket and his government weakened but intact.

It didn't help the cause of European unity that Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were essentially seen to have ganged up on the Italian leader a few days earlier.

Even his fiercest domestic foes were outraged by a photo of Merkel and Sarkozy smirking knowingly at each other when asked at a news conference what they'd said to Berlusconi during a private meeting.

"People are well aware that at the moment the EU is not functioning in an optimal way," said Daniela Schwarzer, an analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.

"And they're right."

From the start, the debt crisis has exposed the tensions inherent in the EU between the demands of regional solidarity and the realities of national politics.

Merkel, for one, has often declared her willingness to do "whatever it takes" to save the shared euro currency.

But that apparently does not encompass issuing common Eurozone debt or letting the European Central Bank buy more bonds of troubled nations.

Those are measures that many experts say could go a long way toward solving the problem but that German voters oppose.

Instead, Northern European nations, led by Germany, have complained loudly about having to bail out fiscally irresponsible neighbors such as Greece and Portugal.

And further steps taken at more than a dozen summits in 18 months have been quickly overtaken by events.

"The decisions were systematically too little too late," Schwarzer said.

Some experts say that had Germany pushed for a bigger rescue of Greece back in the spring of 2010, the crisis could have been nipped in the bud.

On Wednesday, after Merkel told German lawmakers that "what's good for Europe is good for Germany," opposition leader Frank-Walter Steinmeier shot back, "I wish I had heard a lot of these sentences a year ago."

The German Parliament gave Merkel a strong mandate to increase the bailout fund's firepower but, notably, it was on the premise that Berlin wouldn't have to cough up any more of the money.

One of the alternatives under consideration for boosting the fund involved trying to attract investors from emerging economies, raising the prospect of the world's richest trading bloc appealing for help from such nations as India and Brazil.

While many have accused the EU of dithering throughout the crisis, some say that characterization is unfair.

Leaders are rightly constrained by domestic politics and public opinion, they say, and their disputes are part of the democratic process.

"It gets a bit much to expect individuals, whether it's Sarkozy or Merkel or anyone else, to be these magicians or to pull some idea out of a hat," said Chris J. Bickerton, a political scientist at the University of Amsterdam.

"It's not really individual leaders that'll generate solutions.

It's a broader public debate about the options."

But the question is how much time Europe has to hash out those options before the crisis overtakes it completely.

And the longer the seeming indecision drags on, the more confidence in the EU plummets.

"The fact that they are not able to come to an agreement shows the markets that the European Union is extremely fragile, and that the EU could potentially crack," said Henri Sterdyniak, an expert at the Paris Institute of Political Sciences.

"There is a lack of leadership, and we have nobody to impose a strategy in Europe."

Greek debt deal eases jittery EU market

Kansas City Business Journal

Date:

Thursday, October 27, 2011, 8:04am CDT

European leaders got an agreement from banks to accept a 50 percent loss on their Greek debt, a key part of building a comprehensive package to protect the euro, The New York Times reports .

The deal would cut Greek debt to 120 percent of its gross domestic product by 2020, a figure that remains enormous but is nevertheless sustainable, the report said.

The accord on Greek debt came after European leaders agreed Wednesday on a plan to build banksâ€™ bailout fund to protect Italy and Spain from sparking a new crisis.

Merkel Says Germany Rejects ECB Bond Reference in EU Text

By                     Patrick Donahue                  -

Tue Oct 25 15:18:44 GMT 2011

Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany opposed the inclusion of a reference to the European Central Bank continuing its bond-buying program in a draft text prepared for a crisis summit of European leaders tomorrow.

“The sentence as it is in the communique at present is not acceptable to Germany,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin today.

While officials are still working on the text, “the wording doesn’t state that there should be more secondary market purchases, but rather that the non-standard methods of the European Central Bank could be pursued further,” she said.

“We are moving in the direction that we would rather have a statement from the ECB on what they would like to do,” Merkel said.

The idea is to avoid “a misunderstanding that policy leaders expect something from the ECB.”

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi met with European Union President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Barroso today before an EU summit in Brussels.

During the 15-minute meeting, the three leaders discussed a letter from Berlusconi that outlines his plan for structural reforms intended to boost Italian economic growth.

The EU increased pressure on Berlusconi this week to say how he’ll reach budget-reduction targets.

EU Official Says EFSF Capacity May Be Determined by End November

By                     Patrick Henry                  -

Wed Oct 26 14:05:41 GMT 2011

European Union leaders may ask national finance ministers to determine the capacity of the expanded European Financial Stability Facility by the end of November, an EU official said.

The leaders meet in Brussels later today and will back two EFSF leveraging options set out last week, the official said on condition of anonymity because the meeting hasn’t taken place yet.

The capacity of the euro area’s temporary bailout fund depends on the extend of bondholder participation in a second Greek rescue package and the size of that program, the official said.

The EFSF will probably have between 250 billion euros and 275 billion euros left after the second Greek package is completed, so any leveraging would be based on that amount, the official said.

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel

Chancellor Angela Merkel invoked Germany’s “historic obligation” to defend the euro and Europe as she urged lawmakers to back a planned increase in the euro-area rescue fund’s capacity to staunch the debt crisis.

Chancellor Angela Merkel invoked Germany ’s “historic obligation” to defend the euro and Europe as she urged lawmakers to back a planned increase in the euro- area rescue fund’s capacity to staunch the debt crisis.

Merkel said the financial risk inherent in leveraging the 440 billion-euro ($612 billion) backstop is “acceptable,” and that bondholders must give Greece a bigger break to relieve the debt load at the heart of the turmoil sweeping Europe.

“The world is watching Europe and Germany,” Merkel said in a speech today to the lower house in Berlin, the Bundestag.

“It’s watching whether we’re ready and able in the hour of Europe’s deepest crisis since the end of World War II to accept responsibility.”

Merkel was speaking at the start of a debate and vote on the rescue fund before she travels to Brussels for the second crisis summit in four days.

As the contagion threatens Italy , European leaders are tightening the screws on Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to bring concrete reforms to the meeting.

The summit negotiations “won’t be easy,” Merkel said.

The principle goal is to lower Greece’s debt level to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020, according to the chancellor.

“That can’t be done unless the private sector bears a considerably higher share of the burden” than the 21 percent cut in Greek debt holding envisaged at a July 21 summit of European leaders, she said.

Cross-Party Backing

Merkel’s coalition ensured cross-party support to increase the effectiveness of the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund after persuading the main opposition Social Democrats and Greens to sign up to a motion that includes a cap on German guarantees.

“The chancellor will travel to Brussels today bolstered by a clear and very broad mandate from the German Bundestag,” Peter Altmaier , the deputy parliamentary leader and chief party whip of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union , said in an interview on Deutschlandfunk radio.

German backing for the scaled up EFSF is still just one piece in the crisis-fighting jigsaw puzzle being assembled.

Agreement is still lacking on how to bolster the fund, reductions in Greece’s debt load and recapitalizing banks.

The 17-nation euro gained 0.1 percent to $1.3937 as of 1:26 p.m. in Berlin after climbing to as much as $1.3960 yesterday, the highest since Sept.

8. German two-year notes rose for a third day. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.4 percent after swinging between gains and losses.

‘Turning Point’

The crisis summit “is a turning point today because it has the right elements,” Carsten Brzeski , an economist at ING Group in Brussels, said in an interview with Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television today.

“Nevertheless there is a fatigue on financial markets listening to politicians always coming up with the ultimate, final plan.”

In Italy, la Repubblica newspaper reported that Berlusconi agreed with Umberto Bossi , leader of the Northern League party which holds the key to Berlusconi’s parliamentary majority, to hold early elections in exchange for a deal on revamping pensions, liberalization and bureaucracy.

Berlusconi agreed to step down by January and to bring elections forward to March 2012, la Repubblica said.

The Bundestag is scheduled to vote at about 2:15 p.m. as it exercises powers over budgetary matters that it won last month after complaints by coalition lawmakers they were being steamrollered into accepting decisions made in Brussels affecting German finances.

“We’re all in new territory,” Merkel said.

Brussels Guidelines

The motion before parliament lays down guidelines for Merkel to take to Brussels, including a cap on German guarantees at the existing level of 211 billion euros and a request that the budget committee or the full chamber be given another vote after leverage models have been worked up. It also “notes” that there is no need for the European Central Bank ’s secondary- market bond-buying program to remain in place once the enhanced rescue fund is enacted.

“For us it was a condition that the Bundestag, respecting the central bank’s independence, has a clear position:

no more unconditional debt-buying by the ECB,” Carsten Schneider, the Social Democratic Party ’s budget spokesman in parliament, told reporters after a budget committee meeting late yesterday.

Merkel’s bloc has 330 seats in the 620-member Bundestag, allowing her to pass legislation with a simple majority of 311 votes with as many as 19 coalition dissenters.

With the help of SPD and Green support, she won a Sept.

29 ballot on enhancements to the EFSF by 523 votes in favor to 85 against.

“We need a simple coalition majority,” Klaus-Peter Flosbach, the finance-policy spokesman of Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc in parliament, said in an e-mailed statement.

“I have no doubt that we’ll achieve that.”

Mario Draghi

As next week’s Group of 20 summit looms, nations from Greece to Italy remain under pressure to restore fiscal order and the onus is on a Mario Draghi-run European Central Bank to keep buying bonds.

European leaders bolstered their crisis-fighting toolbox with a plan that may generate only limited relief for stressed sovereigns unless it can be fleshed- out within weeks.

“It remains a deal long on intentions and short on details,” said Jens Larsen , chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets in London.

“Until we know how the mechanisms will work, it will be hard to judge whether this will be sufficient to entice investors to provide support to European governments.”

Europe’s currency, stocks and bonds rose after 10 hours of talks ended in Brussels with governments boosting the heft of their rescue fund to 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion) and persuading bondholders to take 50 percent losses on Greek debt.

Measures also included a recapitalization of European banks and a potentially bigger role for the International Monetary Fund in strengthening the bailout fund.

Still to be worked out in negotiations, which may fall prey to fresh bouts of political infighting and investor revolt, is just how the firepower of the 440 billion-euro rescue facility will be leveraged and what banks will get in return for accepting the Greek haircut.

As next week’s Group of 20 summit looms, nations from Greece to Italy remain under pressure to restore fiscal order and the onus is on a Mario Draghi-run European Central Bank to keep buying bonds.

Buying Time

“The announcement is enough to buy some time,” said Charles Diebel , head of market strategy at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London.

“Officials have certainly come up with a comprehensive list of actions, but we are certainly still a long way from all the process parts being in place.”

The euro rose as much as 2 percent to $1.4181, the highest since July 1. Yields on Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds fell and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index surged 3.5 percent to the highest since Aug. 3.

There have been false dawns before in the two years since Greece first revised its budget math.

Policy makers initially underestimated the threat posed by the Mediterranean nation and then repeatedly failed to muster the financial firepower to prevent it from engulfing Portugal and Ireland before tainting Italy and Spain.

Leaders had already declared victory after July talks which featured a 21 percent Greek writedown.

Italian Auction

“Markets now appear to be resigned to tardiness on the part of policy makers and grudgingly prepared to accept that resolution will not be achieved in a single step,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said in a note to clients.

An early test of Europe’s latest initiative comes tomorrow when Italy auctions as much as 8.5 billion euros of bonds.

The euro-area’s third-largest economy has become a focal point as investors question whether authorities can ring fence the country’s 1.9 trillion euros of borrowing, the euro-region’s second-biggest debt burden in nominal terms after Germany.

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi heard demands from EU allies at the summit to present a comprehensive plan to speed debt reduction by spurring economic growth that has lagged behind the EU average for more than a decade.

Weeks of bickering within his ruling coalition made it impossible for Berlusconi to pass new measures and he instead offered a 14-page blueprint for reforms that pledged action on asset sales, easing of labor laws and raising the retirement age .

Recession Threat

The summit was the second in four days and the 14th in the 21 months since Europe pledged solidarity with Greece . It came amid mounting global pressure for the euro-area to quarantine Greece and prevent speculation against Italy, Spain and France from ravaging its economy and triggering the second global recession in three years.

“The world’s attention was on these talks,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters after the summit concluded at about 4:15 a.m. today. “We Europeans showed tonight that we reached the right conclusions.”

Banks bowed to pressure from leaders as their negotiator agreed to higher “voluntary losses” to smooth a second bailout for Greece, which will now include 130 billion euros of official aid, up from 109 billion euros envisioned in July.

Just hours before the accord, Institute of International Finance Managing Director Charles Dallara said “there is no agreement,” before he received a rare invite to join the talks.

Greek Haircut

The banks’ resistance was broken by a threat “to move toward a scenario of total insolvency of Greece, which would have cost states a lot of money and which would have ruined the banks,” Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said.

Still to be decided are the finer points of the write-off such as the collateral banks will be given in return and whether future bank debt is backed by a national or European guarantee.

Banks and insurers will be asked to accept a writedown of half the nominal value of their Greek bonds.

That “haircut” aims to reduce the country’s debt level to 120 percent of gross domestic product in 2020, still twice the EU limit, though down from the 162 percent forecast for this year.

Dallara said in Brussels today that he was confident the participation rate would “very, very high.”

The writedown will make Greece’s debt more sustainable though “this position is fragile and dependent on a set of rather optimistic macro assumptions,” said Nicola Mai, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. If the country’s economy fails to rebound more debt restructuring may be needed, he said.

Leveraging EFSF

Leaders backed two ways of leveraging up the European Financial Stability Facility, which is too small to defend countries such as Italy, which has a debt of more than three times the EFSF.

Under plans to be spelled out in November, the fund will be used to partly insure bond sales and a special investment vehicle will be created that would court outside money from public and private financial institutions and investors to further boost its muscle.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke today with Chinese President Hu Jintao to try to tap support from the country with the world’s largest currency reserves.

Hu hopes that the measures will help to stabilize markets, state-owned China Central Television reported after the call.

Japan plans to support the increase, and is waiting to hear from European officials on details for the program, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Two-Tier Market

The insurance scheme may still fail to draw investors amid concern its sponsors won’t honor their commitments and questions over the timeframe and amount of guarantees on offer, said Karen Ward , an economist at HSBC Holdings Plc. It could also create a two-tier bond market as investors shy away from the previously- issued unprotected debt, she said.

Economists at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said the 1 trillion-euro goal still falls short of what’s necessary to truly defend Spain and Italy, while warning the special investment vehicle may struggle to issue enough cheap debt to lure outside investors.

The very use of leverage drew criticism from the Bundesbank with President Jens Weidmann saying the “instruments that have been tabled are similar in their design to those that helped to cause the crisis.”

Europe also struck a bank-recapitalization accord, setting a June 30, 2012, deadline for lenders to reach core capital reserves of 9 percent after first writing down their sovereign- debt holdings.

Banks that fail to raise enough capital on the markets will first tap national governments, falling back on the EFSF rescue fund only as a last resort.

Bank Capital

The challenges to overcome on that front include deciding which assets banks can count as capital and how financial institutions will raise it given their reluctance to seek cash from shareholders.

The European Banking Authority estimated banks’ capital needs at 106 billion euros, with Spanish banks requiring 26.2 billion euros and Italian banks 14.8 billion euros.

The figure is “at the low end of expectations,” said Philippe Bodereau, head of credit research at Pacific Investment Management Co. in a telephone interview.

“It would be positive if we saw banks launching rights issues, but most will try to get there by selling businesses, retaining earnings, cutting dividends and deleveraging.”

ECB Role

Leaders tiptoed around the broader role of the politically independent ECB in keeping the euro sound, making no mention of its bond-purchase program in a 15-page statement.

The Frankfurt- based central bank was said to be purchasing Italian debt today and Holger Schmieding of Joh. Berenberg Gossler & Co. said it will likely have to keep doing so as policy makers round off their plan.

Incoming ECB President Draghi yesterday indicated the policy will continue.

“Without ECB support, the chances of this deal putting an end to the euro debt crisis are now probably below 50 percent,” said Schmieding, Berenberg’s chief economist.

The pact received conditional support from abroad as leaders prepare for the Nov. 3-4 G-20 summit in Cannes, France, which had been set as a deadline for a new European plan and may pave the way for more international assistance.

The U.S. Treasury had no immediate comment on the European agreement.

“They need to keep up momentum and urgently to fill in the elements” of the package, said U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron . Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the agreement “grounds for cautious optimism,” which now needs to be detailed and implemented.

Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel.

Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel.

Chancellor Angela Merkel emerged from 10 hours of negotiations in Brussels with a plan to stem the debt crisis that might as well have been written in Berlin.

The German leader forced French President Nicolas Sarkozy to bend to her will on using the European rescue fund only as a last resort, ruled out an automatic crisis-fighting role for the European Central Bank and dragged banks back to the table to take greater losses on Greek debt.

She even wrung further budget concessions out of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .

“Merkel got what she wanted,” Shada Islam, an analyst at the Friends of Europe policy-advisory group in Brussels, said by phone yesterday after the summit ended.

“This has confirmed Germany ’s role as the make-or-break player not only in the euro- zone crisis but in European Union affairs beyond Europe.”

Two years after the debt crisis came to light in Greece, Merkel is finally translating her status as leader of Europe’s biggest economy and biggest contributor to euro-area bailouts into international clout.

It may come too late to change opinion at home, where voters punished her coalition for flip-flops over tackling the crisis at seven state elections this year.

“Confidence in this government has suffered a lot,” Peter Matuschek, an analyst at the Berlin-based Forsa polling group, said by phone.

“As a voter, you look for orientation, so it’s good that she’s at least able to give the impression of being decisive.” The chancellor has “gained some breathing room.”

Bundestag Backing

Seventy-six percent of German voters in a poll taken on the eve of the summit said they were unhappy with the government’s handling of the crisis and 20 percent said they were satisfied.

The Infratest poll of 1,001 voters was conducted Oct. 25-26 for ARD television and released today.

Merkel traveled to Brussels on Oct. 26 bolstered by a parliament vote in Berlin that allowed her to negotiate to raise the capacity of the 440 billion-euro ($618 billion) rescue fund.

She won cross-party support after pledging that German guarantees wouldn’t be raised from the existing level of 211 billion euros and the ECB shouldn’t be relied upon to continue its bond-buying program to staunch the crisis.

No mention of the ECB’s bond-purchase program was made in the summit’s 15-page statement.

Addressing lawmakers before she left Berlin, Merkel said that the summit’s main goal would be to cut Greece ’s debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020, a level that international creditors said last week could be achieved if bondholders accepted voluntary 50 percent losses.

Banks bowed to pressure yesterday to accept a 50 percent haircut on Greek debt after Merkel made clear it was European leaders’ “last word.”

‘German Handwriting’

Sarkozy had wanted the rescue fund to be used to bail out distressed banks.

Merkel stipulated that the fund should be used only as a backstop of last resort.

Taken together, the decisions clearly display “German handwriting,” Deputy Finance Minister Joerg Asmussen , who attended the summit, said later in Berlin.

Merkel’s domestic allies praised her Brussels performance.

The summit was a “breakthrough” in fighting the crisis and a “great success for the chancellor,” Volker Kauder , the floor leader of her Christian Democratic Union , said in an interview with Focus magazine.

Otto Fricke , budget spokesman in parliament for her Free Democratic Party coalition partner, which has flirted with an anti-bailout stance, told broadcaster Phoenix that the outcome was a “big step forward.” Even Carsten Schneider, Fricke’s opposition counterpart from the Social Democratic Party , said the 50 percent reduction in Greek debt was “okay,” though it “ought to have come far sooner.”

Bild’s Verdict

“Merkel’s euro rescue,” Germany’s best-selling Bild newspaper said on its front page today.

“It was an all-night poker session -- and Chancellor Angela Merkel the winner.”

Since October 2009, when Merkel formed her second-term government and Greece’s debt burden began to emerge with the arrival of George Papandreou as Greek prime minister, the German government parties have lost ground to the opposition.

Merkel’s coalition trails the opposition Social Democrats and Greens by 34 percent to 43 percent, a Forsa poll for Stern magazine showed Oct. 26. That’s down from the 48.4 percent won by Merkel’s Christian Democrats and Free Democrats at the 2009 election.

The SPD and Greens, traditional allies which governed together from 1998 to 2005, took 33.7 percent in 2009.

The next federal election is due in the fall of 2013.

After a positive EU summit, Merkel “could take advantage of it to stabilize the situation,” said Forsa’s Matuschek.

At least until next week, when Merkel will press global leaders at a Group of 20 meeting in Cannes, France , on a financial transaction tax and measures to tackle banks deemed “too big to fail.” She will also present Europe ’s plan to leaders including President Barack Obama , who has repeatedly prodded Merkel and her euro colleagues to stamp out the crisis.

“We’ve achieved some things,” Merkel told lawmakers on Oct. 26. “A more important step will be taken in Cannes.”

Bryssels, Oct. 26 (BNA) -- Leaders of the 27-member European Union are to meet here later on Wednesday for the second time in three days to agree on how to deal with the debt and financial crisis plaguing Europe.

"We will finalise Eurozone decision making on Wednesday evening, 26 October, " President of the EU Council Herman Van Rompuy had declared after last Sunday's EU summit.

The EU leaders have to agree on the recapitalisation of banks and to give more firepower to the EU's 440 billion euro bailout fund called the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).

German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a vote in the German parliament Wednesday on increasing the EFSF's firepower .

However, the main challenges before the EU leaders is how to prevent the Greek debt crisis from spreading to other Eurozone countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal.

According to unconfirmed reports , an agreement has been reached that European banks must raise more than 100 billion euros in new capital to protect them against possible losses to indebted countries.

No agreement , however , has yet been reached on the Greek haircut, which means how much of Greece's debt should be written off with speculationS ranging between 50 to 75 percent.

The summit of the 27 EU leaders will be followed by a meeting tonight of th

e 17 eurozone leaders whose countries use the common euro currency.

BERLIN

Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday she hopes for wide domestic support of her eurozone rescue efforts ahead of an expected parliamentary vote on plans to increase the firepower of the currency bloc's rescue fund.

Germany's main parties were working on a joint text to put to a vote Wednesday, just ahead of a European Union summit, and the biggest opposition party signaled that it plans to back the plans.

The EU summit will consider plans to boost the euro440 billion ($600 billion) bailout fund by offering government bond buyers insurance against possible losses and attracting capital from private investors and sovereign wealth funds.

Before leaving for Brussels, Merkel is seeking the German parliament's approval.

She said Tuesday she aims for "support that is as wide as possible" for her efforts.

She looked likely to get her wish, with a key opposition leader saying that "we have a great interest in the second part of the European summit not failing."

Still, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the parliamentary leader of the center-left Social Democrats, complained that there's still too little detail on the plans.

He said parties are working together to draw up a text to put to a vote, and he called for the German parliament to vote again after the summit once its results are finalized.

Wednesday's vote comes about a month after the German parliament approved moves to expand the size and powers of the fund, the so-called European Financial Stability Facility.

Several skeptics in Merkel's governing coalition opposed that move, though not enough to cause her trouble, and said they will again vote "no" on Wednesday.

"We've been told again and again, if you vote 'yes' now then we have solved the problems ... and things have always tended to get more difficult," said Wolfgang Bosbach, a rebel lawmaker from Merkel's Christian Democrats.

"With rescue funds that get bigger and bigger, we are delaying into the future the solution of the problems and piling burdens onto the young generation," Bosbach said on n-tv television.

BERLIN

Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated Wednesday that private investors like banks should take a writedown of at least 50 percent on their Greek debt holdings and told German lawmakers the world is waiting to see whether Europe can get a grip on its debt crisis.

Merkel sought German lawmakers' support for her euro rescue efforts amid uncertainty over whether European leaders would be able to nail down a comprehensive plan to solve the continent's debt crisis at a high-stakes summit in Brussels later in the day.

"The world is watching Europe and Germany;

it is watching whether we are ready and able, in the hour of Europe's most serious crisis since the end of World War II, to take responsibility," Merkel told parliament.

Europe has already bailed out three small eurozone members -- Greece, Portugal and Ireland -- but fears it cannot bail out the troubled economies of Italy and Spain, the third and fourth largest economies in the 17-nation currency bloc.

It also knows that the first bailout for Greece was not close to big enough to keep the country from defaulting.

With that in mind, European officials are working on several plans at once -- resolving Greece's debt situation, strengthening the continent's banks, which are expected to take deeper losses on their Greek bonds than they had planned, making sure other eurozone nations don't need bailouts and boosting the EU bailout fund itself.

"We need a deal tonight and we need political agreement to the key aspects that are on the table," European Commission spokesman Olivier Bailly said in Brussels.

However, he added that it was too early to say whether there would be clear figures for writedowns on Greek debt or on the future firepower of the eurozone bailout fund, whose lending capacity is now at euro440 billion ($600 billion).

German opposition leaders briefed by Merkel say changes would take the fund's lending capacity above euro1 trillion ($1.4 trillion), but that has yet to be finalized.

Another open question was whether Italy will be able to convince its partners that it can get its economy back on track in return for help.

One key issue in Brussels will be renegotiating a deal made in July under which Greece's private bondholders agreed to accept losses of 21 percent on their holdings of government debt.

That is now seen by EU governments as too little.

Merkel said the summit's aim must be a solution that allows Greece to cut its debt load to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020.

"That won't work without the private sector participating to a significantly higher extent" than was agreed in July, Merkel said.

She didn't spell out how much banks and other bondholders should contribute.

But according to Greece's international creditors, a cut of 50 percent on Greek bonds now would take the country's debt to just above 120 percent of GDP.

Greece's debts are set to spiral above an estimated 180 percent of economic output next year.

But Merkel insisted that cutting Greece's debts alone won't solve the country's economic problems.

"Painful and necessary structural reforms must be implemented," she said.

She added that a "permanent surveillance" of Greece would therefore be "desirable."

Athens' financial reform efforts have been monitored every three months by inspectors from the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund since it received a bailout in May 2010.

Greece has opposed calls for a permanent surveillance mechanism.

Merkel didn't mention Italy, where Premier Silvio Berlusconi averted a government collapse to clinch an overnight deal on emergency growth measures demanded by the EU.

Berlusconi and coalition partner Umberto Bossi reached a compromise on raising Italy's pension age -- a point of disagreement that had threatened Berlusconi's leadership.

While pressing the private sector on Greece, Merkel stressed the need for Europe to also make sure the crisis doesn't spread yet further, saying that recapitalizing troubled banks is "absolutely necessary."

"Anyone who wants private creditors to participate in debt sustainability must also ensure that a screening off, a protection against the danger of contagion is decided at the same time," Merkel told lawmakers.

"Anything else is simply irresponsible."

The EU summit will consider plans to boost the euro440 billion ($610 billion) Financial Stability Fund, or EFSF, by offering government bond buyers insurance against possible losses and attracting capital from private investors and sovereign wealth funds.

Germany's government decided to put that move to a vote in parliament, and thrashed out a joint resolution with two of the three opposition parties.

Germany, as the largest economy in the 17-nation eurozone, will be paying out a large share of the bailout money.

The risks Germany will shoulder are "justifiable," Merkel said.

"I'll even go a step further and say that it would not be justifiable and responsible not to take the risk," she added.

"I do not have a better alternative."

In her speech, Merkel stressed that the EU must be prepared to overhaul its treaties to overcome the crisis for good and ensure a better functioning of the eurozone's 17 nations and the EU's 27 members.

A future treaty must allow that eurozone countries not living up to their fiscal and budgetary responsibilities under the bloc's growth and stability pact be taken to the European Court of Justice, she said.

Wednesday's joint resolution underlines the German parliament's expectations that, once the changes are implemented, the European Central Bank will no longer need to buy government bonds, as it has since last year -- a move that has caused concern in Germany.

With eurozone politicians disagreeing over how to calm the debt crisis, the ECB has taken on the role of firefighter by buying up the bonds of financially weakened governments on the open market.

That keeps the bond prices up and the interest rates down, allowing troubled European countries to borrow on financial markets at lower rates than they otherwise could.

The ECB has bought euro169.5 billion ($236 billion) in government bonds since mid-2010.

BRUSSELS

Poland's finance minister says big European banks will be required to raise their capital cushions to 9 percent of their risky investments by June.

That's in line with international banking guidelines that come into effect in 2019.

Polish Finance Minister Jan Vincent-Rostowski announced the new rules after a meeting Wednesday of the leaders of the 27 countries that make up the European Union.

European banks need to shore up their finances because they have significant exposure to debt by governments with shaky finances.

On Greece's debt, for instance, they could soon be asked to take substantial losses, as leaders try to find a way to dig Europe out of its debt crisis by lightening Greece's debt load.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE.

Check back soon for further information.

AP's earlier story is below.

BRUSSELS (AP) -- European leaders rushed to Brussels Wednesday facing colossal pressure to do what they have failed to in numerous previous meetings:

produce a comprehensive solution to the continent's increasingly unmanageable debt crisis.

As the summit began, the heads of state and government remained deeply divided on some of the key issues they need to solve or risk renewed turbulence on financial markets across the globe.

The fear is that more delays and half-baked solutions could push not only Europe, but much of the rest of the developed world back into recession, eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs and even spell the failure of the euro, the common currency that is at the heart of Europe's postwar unity.

"Our challenge today is not simply to save the euro.

It's to safeguard the ideals we cherish so much in Europe:

peaceful cooperation amongst our nations, social cohesion and solidarity without prejudice amongst our people," said George Papandreou, the prime minister of Greece, whose country kicked off the continent's debt drama almost two years ago.

Whether Wednesday's summit -- which was expected to last deep into the night -- would indeed turn out to be the grand solution the markets are expecting and the eurozone has been promising was unclear Wednesday evening.

In particular, there was still no agreement on how to cut Greece's debt, which is set to top 180 percent of economic output next year.

On this issue the 17-country eurozone remained locked in discussions with banks and other private holders of Greek bonds, who have been resisting a demand from the eurozone to take significant losses.

At the same time, the eurozone itself was divided over how far a restructuring of Greece's debt should go.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel told lawmakers in Berlin that the goal was to bring Greece's debt down to 120 percent of economic output by 2020.

That would imply a cut of more than 50 percent to the face value of Greek bonds and may be more than private investors would be willing to accept voluntarily.

Merkel's Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann told reporters that a cut of "40 to 50 percent is part of the debate."

Germany has threatened to force losses on Greek debt holders if they don't accept sufficient losses voluntarily, while France, the European Commission and the European Central Banks insist that any debt relief had to remain voluntary.

Doubts remained also over the second key issue on the table:

How to give the eurozone's bailout fund, the euro440 billion ($612 billion) European Financial Stability Facility, the firepower it needs to stop the crisis from engulfing large economies like Italy and Spain and help prevent big banks from collapsing amid the worsening market turmoil.

"I think that effectively, it has to be able to intervene a good deal beyond euro1 trillion ($1.4 trillion)," Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme said of the bailout fund, also known as the EFSF.

Since states have ruled out boosting their financial commitments to the fund, the eurozone was working on two complex schemes that would allow the EFSF to act as an insurer for new bonds from wobbly countries like Italy and Spain.

If the fund promised to compensate investors against the first 20 percent or 30 percent of losses in the case of a default, that would make those bonds a much safer investments.

Spending some euro250 billion on guarantees, could under that scheme attract new lending of up to euro1 trillion.

However, before rich countries like Germany, France or the Netherlands are willing to sign up for such a scheme, they want assurances that countries that benefit from the fund's protection will get their economies back on track.

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in particular was facing pressure to convince his eurozone colleagues of his reliability at Wednesday's summit.

"Our Italian friends know exactly that we have to insist that tonight they tell us that we get important structural consolidation measures in Italy," said Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker.

"That is a must."

More progress was in sight for a plan to force banks across Europe to significantly increase their capital buffers to ensure they can withstand growing market pressures and large losses on Greek debt.

But the new bank rules affect the 27-counrty European Union, not just the 17-state eurozone, and the non-euro countries do not want to reveal details of the plan before the other main issues have been resolved.

BRUSSELS

Private investors agreed Thursday morning to accept losses of 50 percent on their Greek bonds, a European Union official said, removing the last apparent roadblock to a broad plan to solve the continent's debt crisis.

The deal with private creditors would significantly cut Greece's debt load, the very problem that kicked off the eurozone's debt drama almost two years ago.

At an emergency summit in Brussels, European leaders had already agreed to force banks to raise euro106 billion ($148 billion) by June -- partially to ensure they could weather the expected losses on Greek debt.

They also neared agreement on boosting the firepower of the continent's bailout fund to around euro1 trillion ($1.4 trillion) to help it protect larger economies like Italy and Spain from the sort of market pressures that pushed Greece to need a rescue.

While the breakthrough on Greece, the bailout fund and strengthening the banks was a big success for the eurozone, much of the effectiveness of the plans will depend on the details, which will have to be finalized in the coming days and weeks.

The leaders were under immense pressure to finally get a grip on the eurozone's escalating debt crisis after multiple delays and half-baked solutions.

Market confidence was waning and fears were growing that the crisis could push Europe and much of the developed world back into recession.

But the third prong of their plan -- finding a way to reduce Greece's crushing debts, which are on track to top 180 percent of economic output -- had been proving difficult, driving leaders, national finance experts and bank representatives to continue talks deep into the night.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel told lawmakers in Berlin that the goal was to bring Greece's debt down to 120 percent of economic output by 2020.

There were concerns that that would require losses that the banks weren't willing to take on voluntarily.

Having a voluntary deal is important because imposing losses on banks can trigger massive bond insurance payments that risk creating huge turmoil on global financial markets.

A European official said early Thursday that a voluntary deal had been reached.

Another official confirmed that the banks agreed to take losses of 50 percent of their Greek bonds.

According to Greece's debt inspectors that would take the country's debt to just above 120 percent by 2020.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending an official statement.

A spokesman for the organization that has negotiated on behalf of the banks said he would release a statement soon, without confirming the deal.

EU Official Says Summit May Pave Way for Further Bank Talks

By Chiara Vasarri

Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi met with European Union President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Barroso today before an EU summit in Brussels.

During the 15-minute meeting, the three leaders discussed a letter from Berlusconi that outlines his plan for structural reforms intended to boost Italian economic growth.

The EU increased pressure on Berlusconi this week to say how he’ll reach budget-reduction targets.

EU Official Says Summit May Pave Way for Further Bank Talks

By Patrick Henry

Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- European Union leaders may ask national finance ministers to determine the capacity of the expanded European Financial Stability Facility by the end of November, an EU official said.

The leaders meet in Brussels later today and will back two EFSF leveraging options set out last week, the official said on condition of anonymity because the meeting hasn’t taken place yet.

The capacity of the euro area’s temporary bailout fund depends on the extend of bondholder participation in a second Greek rescue package and the size of that program, the official said.

The EFSF will probably have between 250 billion euros and 275 billion euros left after the second Greek package is completed, so any leveraging would be based on that amount, the official said.

Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- European Union talks with banks on bondholder losses as part of a second Greek rescue package are deadlocked and have been suspended, an EU official said.

The EU is seeking voluntary participation by banks, though a forced solution can’t be ruled out, the official said in Brussels today on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.

While policy makers and bankers are converging on a 50 percent writedown for Greece’s lenders, the disagreement centered on the specifics of the transaction.

The dispute focused on how much of the risk of newly issued Greek bonds should be insured, the official said.

EU leaders meet in Brussels today for the second summit in four days to try to reach an agreement to bolster the region’s rescue fund, strengthen banks and relieve Greece to avoid the contagion spreading to Italy.

Agreement on the size of Greek losses would bring a step closer an announcement on how much additional capital banks will be required to raise to insulate themselves from losses on European sovereign debt.

That may involve the EU setting specific limits on its own and International Monetary Fund participation in the second bailout, the official said.

The Institute of International Finance, which lobbies on behalf of 450 financial firms, yesterday proposed investors make a larger writedown than the 40 percent the group offered last week, said two people with knowledge of the talks.

The European Union is calling on investors to forfeit as much as 60 percent, a person familiar with the talks said last week.

Banks’ Proposal

The latest proposal includes a 50 percent writedown on the net present value of Greek debt, said one of the people who declined to be identified because the talks are private.

Another person cautioned that the writedown may be closer to 45 percent.

It’s still uncertain whether EU leaders will accept even the increased offer, both people said.

“Charles Dallara, managing director of the IIF, on behalf of private investors, made a significant offer last night for a voluntary bond exchange in support of Greece,” IIF spokesman Frank Vogl said by telephone today.

He declined to comment on the content of the offer.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel signaled she’s aiming for a 50 percent writedown on Greek debt as part of a second rescue package.

The goal of policy makers is to lower Greece’s debt level to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020, Merkel told lawmakers in Berlin today before a vote on the rescue.

Troika Estimate

The debt-level goal tallies with estimates made last week by auditors from the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund that Greek debt can be brought to just above 120 percent of GDP by the end of 2020.

To safeguard banks’ finances, EU leaders will set a deadline of June 30, 2012, for banks to have core capital reserves of 9 percent after writing down their holdings of sovereign debt, according to a draft statement prepared for the summit.

The reserves must be of the “highest quality,” according to the document obtained by Bloomberg News.

Lenders are expected first to tap private sources to make up any capital shortfall and “should be subject to constraints regarding the distribution of dividends and bonus payments until the target has been attained.” The document doesn’t give an estimate of total capital EU banks must raise to comply with the rule.

Measures for restoring confidence in the EU’s banks are “urgently needed,” the document says.

They should include steps to “ensure the medium-term funding of banks, in order to avoid a credit crunch and to safeguard the flow of credit to the real economy.”

For more on the European debt crisis, see EXT4.)

Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- European Union talks with banks on bondholder losses as part of a second Greek bailout ran aground, dimming the chances for a comprehensive strategy at a summit to stamp out the debt crisis.

A statement issued close to midnight in Brussels by the Institute of International Finance, the bank lobby, said there was no agreement “on any element of a deal.”

“Work’s not been done yet, but everyone’s coming here today with the goal to progress quite a bit,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters as she arrived for the summit yesterday at about 5 p.m.

The Greek stalemate darkens the summit’s prospects, since a deal struck at an earlier meeting yesterday on recapitalizing banks and later talks on bolstering the euro area’s 440 billion- euro ($608 billion) rescue fund hinge on steering debt-laden Greece toward financial health.

While policy makers and bondholders were converging on a 50 percent writedown of Greek debt, clashes over collateral to underpin the transaction will limit the summit to issuing a mandate for further talks, an EU official said in Brussels on condition of anonymity.

European leaders convened for the second summit in four days -- and the 14th in 21 months -- amid mounting global exasperation over their failure to extinguish the two-year-old crisis that now threatens to ravage Italy and France and brake the world economy.

Stocks Gain

U.S. stocks gained and the euro erased declines on hopes for progress.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1.1 percent in New York trading.

The euro slid 0.1 percent to $1.3891 at 12:50 a.m. in Brussels.

The outlines of a deal to safeguard banks emerged, centering on a June 30, 2012 deadline for lenders to reach core capital reserves of 9 percent after writing down their sovereign debt holdings, according to a statement after all 27 EU leaders met.

A group of 70 European banks will need to raise 106 billion euros in the next eight months to meet the goal, the European Banking Authority, the banking regulator, said.

Greek banks need 30 billion euros;

those in Spain need 26.2 billion euros.

In France, the need totals 8.8 billion euros and in Italy, it’s 14.8 billion euros.

Dividends, Bonuses

Institutions falling below the target would face “constraints” on paying dividends and awarding bonuses.

The leaders showed little appetite for an EU-run plan, bowing to German calls to make European money available only as a last resort.

Details need to be worked out by EU finance ministers, EU President Herman Van Rompuy said in a statement without announcing when that will be done.

The bank-aid program “will only go ahead when the other parts of a full package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight,” U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters after he left and the heads of euro states continued their deliberations.

Euro leaders won’t rule out a forced Greek writedown, while continuing to pursue a “voluntary” solution that would scale up a July accord that foresaw 21 percent losses for bondholders, the EU official said.

Bank Lobbying

The IIF, which lobbies on behalf of 450 financial firms, sweetened its offer yesterday, proposing to go beyond the 40 percent losses it mooted last week, said two people with knowledge of the talks.

“We remain open to a dialogue in search of a voluntary agreement,” Charles Dallara, the IIF’s managing director, who was in Brussels, said in the statement.

He said there was no deal on the details of any transaction or the size of the writedown.

Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, leaders of Europe’s two biggest economies, peeled away to meet Dallara, Van Rompuy and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde in an effort to break the deadlock.

The summit reconvened at about 12:45 a.m.

Leaders weighed two options for extending the reach of the fund:

using it to insure bond sales and to finance a special investment vehicle that would court outside money, including from the IMF.

Sarkozy plans to call Chinese leader Hu Jintao today to discuss China contributing, said a person familiar with the matter.

While markets clamor for a signal that the euro area will devote 1 trillion euros or more to combating the crisis, the EU won’t be able to produce a number until late November, the EU official said.

(For more on the European debt crisis, see EXT4.)

Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Chancellor Angela Merkel headed to a summit to solve the euro debt crisis armed with the endorsement of the German parliament as Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi struggled to meet Europe’s demands to cut pension spending.

“The world is watching Europe and Germany,” Merkel said in a speech today to the lower house in Berlin, the Bundestag.

“It’s watching whether we’re ready and able in the hour of Europe’s deepest crisis since the end of World War II to accept responsibility.”

Merkel was speaking during a debate on plans to scale up the rescue fund before she traveled to Brussels for the second crisis summit in four days.

As the contagion threatens Italy, European leaders are tightening the screws on Berlusconi to bring concrete reforms to the meeting.

The summit talks “won’t be easy,” Merkel said.

The 17-nation euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.3965 as of 3:18 p.m. in Berlin.

The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 1.1 percent.

The chancellor ensured cross-party support in the Bundestag to increase the effectiveness of the European Financial Stability Facility fund after persuading the main opposition Social Democrats and Greens to sign up to a motion that included a cap on German guarantees.

Lawmakers voted 503 in favor of the motion to 89 against;

four abstained.

‘Broad Mandate’

“The chancellor will travel to Brussels today bolstered by a clear and very broad mandate from the German Bundestag,” Peter Altmaier, the deputy parliamentary leader and chief party whip of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, said in an interview on Deutschlandfunk radio.

Merkel told lawmakers that the financial risk inherent in the 440 billion-euro ($612 billion) backstop is “acceptable,” and that bondholders must give Greece a bigger break to relieve the debt load at the heart of the turmoil sweeping Europe.

The principle goal of the summit is to lower Greece’s debt level to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020, according to the chancellor.

“That can’t be done unless the private sector bears a considerably higher share of the burden” than the 21 percent cut in Greek debt holding envisaged at a July 21 summit of European leaders, she said.

German backing for the scaled up EFSF is still just one piece in the crisis-fighting jigsaw puzzle being assembled.

Agreement is still lacking on how to bolster the fund, reductions in Greece’s debt load and recapitalizing banks.

‘Turning Point’

The crisis summit “is a turning point today because it has the right elements,” Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Group in Brussels, said in an interview with Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television today.

“Nevertheless, there is a fatigue on financial markets listening to politicians always coming up with the ultimate, final plan.”

The Bundestag exercised powers over budgetary matters that it won last month after complaints by coalition lawmakers they were being steamrollered into accepting decisions made in Brussels affecting German finances.

“We’re all in new territory,” Merkel said.

(For more on the European debt crisis, see EXT4.)

Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- European leaders cajoled bondholders into accepting 50 percent writedowns on Greek debt and boosted their rescue fund’s capacity to 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion) in a crisis-fighting package intended to shield the euro area.

The 17-nation euro and stocks climbed while bond spreads narrowed after leaders emerged early today from a 10-hour summit in Brussels armed with a plan they said points the way out of the quagmire, albeit with some details still to be ironed out.

“Overall the outcome is better than we anticipated one week ago,” Laurent Bilke, global head of inflation strategy at Nomura International Plc in London, said in an interview.

“There are several issues left open, but I do believe that getting a more necessary debt relief for Greece is a pretty important step.”

Last-ditch talks with bank representatives led to the debt- relief accord, in an effort to quarantine Greece and prevent speculation against Italy and France from ravaging the euro zone and wreaking global economic havoc.

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will address the nation at 8 p.m. in Athens to outline the summit’s ramifications for the country at the eye of the two-year sovereign debt crisis.

“The world’s attention was on these talks,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Brussels at about 4:15 a.m. “We Europeans showed tonight that we reached the right conclusions.”

ECB Role

Measures include recapitalization of European banks, a potentially bigger role for the International Monetary Fund, a commitment from Italy to do more to reduce its debt and a signal from leaders that the European Central Bank will maintain bond purchases in the secondary market.

The euro advanced to a seven-week high against the dollar, rising above $1.40 for the first time since September.

It was at $1.4007 at 11:48 a.m. in Brussels.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index surged 2.6 percent.

“It’s long on words, short on detail,” said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank AG in London.

“The solution that’s been put in place now gives us enough ammunition to stave off any immediate problems but we may well run into other problems down the track.”

The summit was the 14th in the 21 months since Europe pledged solidarity with Greece, and came amid mounting global pressure for the bloc to deliver a credible anti-crisis toolkit before a Group of 20 meeting Nov. 3-4 in Cannes, France.

Banks Summoned

Europe’s leaders took the unusual step of summoning the banks’ representative, Managing Director Charles Dallara of the Institute of International Finance, into the summit to break the deadlock over how to cut Greece’s debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from a forecast of about 170 percent next year.

Dallara squared off with a group led by Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy around midnight after issuing an e- mailed statement that “there is no agreement on any element of a deal.”

Sarkozy said the bankers were escorted in “not to negotiate, but to inform them on decisions taken by the 17 and then they themselves went on to think and work on it.” Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said the banks’ resistance was broken by a threat “to move toward a scenario of total insolvency of Greece, which would have cost states a lot of money and which would have ruined the banks.”

Insolvency Threat

The resulting “voluntary” losses by bondholders were the key plank in a second bailout for Greece, which was awarded 110 billion euros in May 2010 at the outbreak of the crisis.

The new program includes 130 billion euros of official aid, up from 109 billion euros envisioned in July.

The Washington-based IMF, meanwhile, said it is ready to disburse its 2.2 billion-euro share of the next installment of Greece’s original bailout.

The release of the euro zone’s 5.8 billion-euro share was approved last week.

Greek, Spanish, Italian and French bonds all rallied today, with the spreads over benchmark German bunds narrowing.

The yield on German 10-year bonds jumped eight basis points, the most in more than 11 weeks, to 2.11 percent at 10:05 a.m. London

The yield on Greek bonds due in October 2022 fell 117 basis points to 24.15 percent, Spanish 10-year yields dropped 16 basis points to 5.32 percent and Italy’s 10-year bonds advanced for a second day, with yields falling 13 basis points to 5.81 percent.

ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, who has warned against the spillover effects of bond writedowns on the banking system, didn’t take part in the confrontation with bankers on the debt relief.

He later praised the leaders’ determination to get ahead of the crisis.

Trichet’s Call

The measures agreed “have to be fully implemented, as rapidly and effectively as possible,” Trichet, who leaves office Oct. 31, said afterwards.

Leaders tiptoed around the politically independent ECB’s broader role in keeping the euro sound, making no mention of its bond-purchase program in a 15-page statement.

The Frankfurt- based central bank has bought 169.5 billion euros in bonds so far, starting with Greece, Ireland and Portugal last year, then extending the coverage to Italy and Spain in August.

While Trichet didn’t mention the controversial purchases either, his successor, Mario Draghi of Italy, indicated that the policy will continue.

Speaking in Rome yesterday, Draghi said the ECB remains “determined to avoid a poor functioning of monetary and financial markets.”

Leaders backed two ways of leveraging up the 440 billion- euro rescue fund, which was designed last year to shield smaller countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, and lacks the heft to protect Italy, the euro area’s third-largest economy.

Leverage Options

Under plans to be spelled out in November, the fund will be used to insure bond sales and to create a special investment vehicle that would court outside money, from public and private financial institutions and investors.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, speaking at a conference in Perth, Australia, called the agreement “grounds for cautious optimism,” and urged European leaders to work out details of the plan and implement it.

Europe cast about for more international money to aid the rescue, with France’s Sarkozy set to call Chinese leader Hu Jintao tomorrow with the goal of tapping into the world’s largest foreign exchange reserves.

While the mechanics are a work in progress, European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said the leverage effect would multiply the power of the fund by a factor of four to five.

He compared it to normal banking business that needn’t entail excessive risks.

‘Detail Further’

“It will be important to detail further the modalities of how this enhanced EFSF will operate and deliver the scale of support envisaged,” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.

Europe also struck a bank-recapitalization accord, setting a June 30, 2012, deadline for lenders to reach core capital reserves of 9 percent after writing down their sovereign-debt holdings.

Banks below that target would face “constraints” on paying dividends and awarding bonuses, a statement said.

The European Banking Authority estimated banks’ capital needs at 106 billion euros, with Spanish banks requiring 26.2 billion euros and Italian banks 14.8 billion euros.

It gave them until Dec. 25 to submit money-raising plans to national supervisors.

Banks that fail to raise enough capital on the markets will first tap national governments, falling back on the EFSF rescue fund only as a last resort.

Europe's leaders intend to multiply their rescue fund fourfold to $1.4 trillion and press Greece's creditors to accept losses of over 50 per cent on their bondholdings, but the details of their plan to end the debt crisis are still not fully formed.

A draft statement from an emergency eurozone summit on Wednesday, obtained by Reuters, outlined two options to leverage the $600-billion fund designed to shore up heavily indebted states and thwart market attacks.

If the draft is adopted with little change, the second summit in four days will have sketched broad intentions but failed to produce a detailed master plan to scale up the fund, recapitalize banks and reduce Greek debt to a sustainable level.

"It's moving in the right direction but it is going to disappoint the market, particularly given the emphasis policy-makers put on this meeting," said Jessica Hoversen, a foreign exchange analyst at MF Global in New York.

One proposal involves creating a special-purpose investment vehicle to tap foreign sovereign and private investors, such as Chinese and Middle Eastern wealth funds, to buy bonds of troubled eurozone countries.

The other method for scaling up the European Financial Stability Facility, which was set up last year, involves using it to offer partial guarantees to purchasers of new eurozone debt.

The two options could be used simultaneously and the International Monetary Fund could also help.

Eurozone finance ministers will be asked to finalize the terms and conditions in November, the statement said.

EU sources said the financial stability facility was expected to be leveraged by something like a factor of four, giving it scope of around $1.4 trillion.

It has about $350 billion to $490 billion available given funds set aside for aid to Greece, Ireland and Portugal and for recapitalizing the region's banks.

European leaders' pattern of responding too little, too late, to a debt crisis that began in Greece has spawned a wider economic and political crisis that threatens to undermine the euro single currency and the European Union project.

A senior EU source said the eurozone leaders want private sector creditors to accept a writedown of more than 50 per cent on their holdings of Greek government debt to reduce Greece's total outstanding private sector debt by about $140 billion.

While there is consensus on the need for European banks to raise around $150 billion in extra capital to withstand a potential Greek debt default, governments and banks are still haggling over the scale of writeoffs.

In an effort to push through the deal, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were prepared to meet with bankers on Wednesday night to negotiate face to face, the senior source said.

EU leaders agreed the outlines of a package on bank recapitalization, including raising the core capital ratios of European banks to nine per cent by the end of June, but they did not provide a headline figure, which will depend in part on negotiations over Greece and its second bailout package.

"There will be give and take with the banks until the last minute," a Greek government source involved in the Brussels negotiations said.

Sarkozy is also expected to talk with Chinese President Hu Jintao soon on Chinese participation in the EFSF bailout fund.

Mario Draghi, the incoming head of the European Central Bank, threw the eurozone a lifeline hours before the summit, signalling the ECB would go on buying troubled states' bonds as leaders of the 17-nation single currency area struggled to agree a convincing set of measures.

"The Eurosystem (of central banks) is determined, with its nonconventional measures, to prevent malfunctioning in the money and financial markets creating an obstacle to monetary transmission," he said in typically coded language in a speech text released in Rome.

Draghi, who will succeed Jean-Claude Trichet on Tuesday, made clear that measures could only be a temporary expedient and said it was up to governments to tackle the roots of the debt crisis that began in Greece two years ago.

Merkel won a parliamentary vote of support for strengthening the rescue fund after warning in a dramatic speech that Europe was facing its most difficult situation since the end of the Second World War.

She told parliament private bondholders would have to take a substantial writedown so that Greece's debt could be reduced to 120 per cent of GDP by 2020 from 160 per cent this year.

World awaits Europe’s answer to debt crisis

Posted by AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE on     October 26, 2011

BRUSSELS, Oct 26 – European leaders faced intense pressure on Wednesday to deliver on a promise to resolve the debt crisis at a summit crucial to the world economy as they battled to protect Italy from collapse.

European Union presidents and prime ministers gather for their second summit in three days with markets demanding a watertight deal to defuse fears that the crisis will deteriorate into a global recession.

The spotlight was on one leader in particular, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, after his EU peers ordered him to return to Brussels with proof of rapid action to cut his country’s debt mountain.

Europe’s leaders were themselves scrambling to produce a multi-pronged battle-plan to shield the euro once and for all.

On what several German dailies called a “day of fate” for the euro Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel was poised to win crucial backing from German lawmakers on beefing up the bailout fund.

Merkel was due to address the chamber at around 1000 GMT, ahead of a debate and the vote and seemed sure to clinch broad support for plans to raise the firepower of the bloc’s 440-billion-euro ($612-billion) war chest to stop the crisis spreading.

Following the vote, Merkel will fly to Brussels where EU leaders were due to gather from 1600 GMT.

With the Greek debt colossus still haunting the eurozone, governments struggled to convince banks to accept massive losses — as much as 50 percent of their bond holdings instead of 21 percent previously agreed.

The Greek debt write-off is a central element in a package that includes recapitalising Europe’s banks so they can absorb the hit, beefing up a rescue fund against further contagion, and strengthening economic governance.

Global partners and competitors, from the United States to Japan and China, are pressing European leaders to finally present a lasting solution.

“This agreement will need to be implemented quickly and firmly,” said Charles Collyns, a top US Treasury official.

French Prime Minister Francois Fillon warned failure “could tip the European continent into unknown territory.”

In Rome, Berlusconi appeared to have reached an 11th-hour deal with his right-wing coalition partners, the Northern League, on a pensions system reform that he could bring to Brussels as evidence of his good will.

Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, whose party has been opposed to pension changes, implied there was an accord, which now faced European scrutiny.

“In the end we found a way but now we have to see what Europe will say,” Bossi said.

Saddled with a 1.9 trillion euro debt mountain, equal to 120 percent of GDP, Italy is paying rates of nearly six percent to borrow on markets, almost triple Germany’s.

The size of the debt has stoked concern that a 440-billion-euro ($605-billion) war chest — the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) — would be insufficient to rescue large economies such as Italy and Spain.

Leaders are examining ways of beefing up its firepower, but first the German parliament has to back the changes at a vote Wednesday, as required by the country’s constitutional court.

One option would be to insure investors against potential losses on bonds of troubled countries, a bid to tempt nervous traders into buying the debt of shaky economies.

The other option is to create a second fund, possibly linked to the EFSF, to entice the likes of China, as well as private investors the world over, to buy this debt.

The head of the eurozone bailout fund will visit China this week, the European Union said Wednesday.

Klaus Regling, chief executive of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), will be in the Chinese capital on Friday, the EU delegation in China said in a statement.

It did not say who Regling would meet or give reasons for his visit, but European leaders have been toying with the idea of asking China, Brazil and other top emerging economies to come to their rescue.

Regling will hold a media briefing on Friday afternoon, the EU said.

The China Daily reported Wednesday that China and other emerging powers have agreed to take part in the bailout.

The state-owned English language newspaper said leading emerging economies would help to finance the rescue fund through the International Monetary Fund, which would boost their voting rights in the Washington-based lender.

The idea is to boost the EFSF’s firepower to more than one trillion euros without increasing the guarantees provided by eurozone states, but the summit is unlikely to announce a headline figure.

In Berlin, Merkel drew a new battleline on the eve of the meeting, insisting that leaders strike out a line in draft conclusions calling on the European Central Bank to keep buying bonds of struggling nations — a role the EFSF is supposed to take over.

British Prime Minister David Cameron is coming into the summit with his own gripe, demanding that the EU’s 10 non-euro nations like his be associated with decisions of the 17-nation eurozone.

The 27-nation EU will meet first at 1600 GMT to decide a recapitalisation of banks amounting to 108 billion euros.

But after that, the 17 eurozone leaders will hold their own summit to finalise their grand deal.

In a marathon summit, European leaders clinched a deal they hope will turn the tide in a two-year-long debt crisis.

"We have reached an agreement, which I believe lets us give a credible and ambitious and overall response to the Greek crisis," French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters after the meeting ended early Thursday.

"Because of the complexity of the issues at stake, it took us a full night," he said.

"But the results will be a source of huge relief worldwide."

The deal came amid immense pressure to craft a strategy designed to prevent the debt crisis from pushing Europe back into recession.

EU leaders also needed to guard against their currency union from falling apart.

Global markets rallied Thursday on news of the agreement.

The deal includes a significant reduction of Greece's debts, shoring up Europe's banks, and adding money to a bailout fund.

The goal of the fund is to prevent larger economies like Italy and Spain from being dragged into the financial crisis.

After the summit, Sarkozy said a Greek default was not an option and that the "the private sector has written off half of Greece's debt that it holds."

The Institute of International Finance said the cut in Greece's debts amounts to 100 billion euros, or $139 billion, for a second rescue.

Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund , said the negotiations had been tough but worth it.

"What we have at the end of the day is a comprehensive plan which includes all the ingredients," she said.

U.S. leaders emphasized the importance of Europe dealing with its debt crisis for the health of the U.S. economy.

"Let me emphasize that the successful resolution of the current European crisis matters deeply to us here in the United States because our country has no bigger, no more important economic relationship than we have with Europe," Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Collyns said.

The European Central Bank president said the new strategy should be "fully implemented as rapidly and effectively as possible."

(AP) 

BRUSSELS - European leaders clinched a deal Thursday they hope will mark a turning point in their two-year debt crisis, agreeing after a night of tense negotiations to have banks take bigger losses on Greece's debts and to boost the region's weapons against the market turmoil.

After months of dawdling and half-baked solutions, the leaders had been under immense pressure to finalize their plan to prevent the crisis from pushing Europe and much of the developed world back into recession and to protect their currency union from unraveling.

World stock markets surged higher Thursday on the news.

Oil prices rose above $92 per barrel while the euro gained strongly  a signal investors were relieved at the outcome of the contentious negotiations.

"We have reached an agreement, which I believe lets us give a credible and ambitious and overall response to the Greek crisis," French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters.

"Because of the complexity of the issues at stake, it took us a full night.

But the results will be a source of huge relief worldwide."

European debt deal done ... sort of

Sarkozy later called his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao and pledged to cooperate to revive global growth, but there was no word on whether Beijing might contribute to Europe's bailout fund.

The fund's chief executive is due to visit Beijing on Friday to talk to potential investors.

Beijing has expressed sympathy for the 27-nation European Union, its biggest trading partner, but has yet to commit any cash.

The strategy unveiled after 10 hours of negotiations focused on three key points.

These included a significant reduction in Greece's debts, a shoring up of the continent's banks, partially so they could sustain deeper losses on Greek bonds, and a reinforcement of a European bailout fund so it can serve as a euro1 trillion ($1.39 trillion) firewall to prevent larger economies like Italy and Spain from being dragged into the crisis.

After several missed opportunities, hashing out a plan was a success for the 17-nation eurozone, but the strategy's effectiveness will depend on the details, which will have to be finalized in the coming weeks.

The most difficult piece of the puzzle proved to be Greece, whose debts the leaders vowed to bring down to 120 percent of its GDP by 2020.

Under current conditions, they would have ballooned to 180 percent.

To achieve that massive reduction, private creditors like banks will be asked to accept 50 percent losses on the bonds they hold.

The Institute of International Finance, which has been negotiating on behalf of the banks, said it was committed to working out an agreement based on that "haircut," but the challenge now will be to ensure that all private bondholders fall in line.

It said the 50 percent cut equals a contribution of euro100 billion ($139 billion) to a second rescue for Greece, although the eurozone promised to spend some euro30 billion ($42 billion) on guaranteeing the remaining value of the new bonds.

The full program is expected to be finalized by early December and investors are supposed to swap their bonds in January, at which point Greece is likely to become the first euro country ever to be rated at default on its debt.

"We can claim that a new day has come for Greece, and not only for Greece but also for Europe," said Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, whose country's troubles touched off the crisis two years ago. "A burden from the past has gone, so that we can start a new era of development."

Not all Greeks were convinced.

Prominent left-wing deputy Dimitris Papadimoulis said the agreement would doom Greeks to a deeper recession.

"The deal puts Greece in a eurozone quarantine," he said.

"We are now locked in a system of continuous austerity, haphazard privatization, and continuous supervision by our creditors."

He also noted an inherent conflict of interest in the plan.

"Those who monitor us do not have our interests in mind.

Their priority is that we pay back our loans," Papadimoulis said.

Since May 2010, Greece has been surviving on rescue loans worth euro110 billion ($150 billion) from the 17 countries that use the euro and the International Monetary Fund since it can't afford to borrow money directly from markets.

In July, those creditors agreed to extend another euro109 billion  but that plan was widely panned as insufficient.

Now, in addition to euro30 billion in bond guarantees, the eurozone leaders and IMF said they will give Greece euro100 billion ($139 billion) in new loans.

With the banks being asked to shoulder more of the burden, though, there were concerns they needed more money in their rainy-day funds to cushion their losses.

So European leaders have asked them to raise euro106 billion ($148 billion) by June.

The last piece in the complicated plan was to increase the firepower of the continent's bailout fund to ensure that other countries with troubled economies  like Italy and Spain  don't get dragged into the crisis.

The third- and fourth-largest economies of the eurozone are too large to be bailed out like the smaller euro nations Greece, Portugal and Ireland have already been.

To that end, the euro440 billion ($610 billion) European Financial Stability Facility will be used to insure part of the potential losses on the debt of wobbly eurozone countries like Italy and Spain, rendering its firepower equivalent to around euro1 trillion ($1.39 trillion).

That should make those countries' bonds more attractive investments and thus lower borrowing costs for their governments.

In addition to acting as a direct insurer of bond issues, the EFSF insurance scheme is also supposed to entice big institutional investors to contribute to a special fund that could be used to buy government bonds but also to help states recapitalize weak banks.

Such outside help may be necessary for Italy and Spain, whose banks were facing some of the biggest capital shortfalls.

On the markets, European trading was buoyant from the outset Thursday on the news.

Britain's FTSE climbed 2.9 percent to 5,712.

Germany's DAX jumped 4.9 percent to 6,311 and France's CAC-40 gained 5.5 percent to 3,344.

Shares in Asia posted solid gains earlier in the day.

The leaders' meeting is a crucial stage in the European Union crisis talks, as the politicians finalise decisions on how to support vulnerable countries and lead the eurozone out of its financial crisis.

The prospects for the talks improved this morning when the German parliament approved a key motion regarding the bailout, giving Chancellor Angela Merkel free rein in the Europe-wide discussions in Brussels later.

As the eurozone's strongest economy, Germany 's role in the talks is key. And Chancellor Merkel was under no illusions about how important it was to try to solve the crisis for the future of both Germany and Europe.

No one should think a further half century of peace and prosperity is assured.

It isn't..if the euro fails, Europe will fail.

Chancellor Angela Merkel

"What is good for Europe is good for Germany, half a century of peace and prosperity in Germany and Europe testify to that," she said.

She added:

"No one should think a further half century of peace and prosperity is assured.

It isn't.

And that's why I say if the euro fails, Europe will fail, and that mustn't happen."

What is the eurozone debt deal all about?

David Cameron said that "some good progress" had been made by EU leaders at the summit.

The Prime Minister, joined by the other 26 EU leaders, said headway had been made on moves to recapitalise banks which had "not been watered down" and was now agreed as part of a three-pronged strategy.

"We have made some good progress tonight," he said.

Bank recapitalisation would only go ahead when all parts of the plan were agreed, he said.

Another key player is Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who is trying to push through austerity plans in his country to ensure it is eligible for the EU's financial protection measures.

A rumour he may be forced to resign over the austerity plan has been denied.

Hurdles

EU leaders need to agree on a plan to raise more than 100bn euros to insulate banks against further economic shocks, as well as a plan to boost the European Stability Facility (EFSF) - Europe's main bailout fund - with more money, via leveraging.

Finally, a decision is still to be made about Greece, and the demand that private investors, mainly banks, absorb a writedown of at least 50 per cent of their loans to Greece.

There are concerns that the talks will not go far enough to solve spiralling fears that the debt crisis will hit the wider global economy.

In part, these are due to the cancellation of one of the meetings due to take place, of the finance ministers.

The authorities played down the cancellation, saying it was procedural, and stressing the meeting of the leaders was more important anyway.

All 27 leaders of countries in the European Union will meet first, before a later meeting between the 17 leaders of eurozone countries.

However experts remain concerned that no finance ministers means no detail.

Channel 4 News Economics Editor Faisal Islam, in Brussels, said:

"For now, no finance ministers means no numbers.

No numbers means no deal worthy of the word.

And no deal means no hope of killing off this crisis."

Europeans wait as leaders debate debt deal

BRUSSELS - Europeans were waiting for a deal to tackle a worsening debt crisis on Wednesday after leaders held an one-hour work session.

The Justus Lipsius building, headquarters of the European Council in the heart of Brussels, has been thrust into the global spotlight as state and government heads gathered for the second time in less than three days.

After their previous summit on Sunday, when they agreed on basic elements of a comprehensive strategy, leaders gathered on Wednesday night to decide how to get out of the debt crisis and how to fiscally govern the European Union.

Despite the immense challenges, the streets around the European Council have been relatively quiet.

The only thing out of the ordinary are the barricades set up to counter any demonstrations that may take place.

The EU cancelled its finance ministers meeting, known as an Ecofin, scheduled ahead of Wednesday night's summit because the details of issues to be discussed at the meeting had not been finalized, sources told Reuters.

But eurozone financial officials were meeting ahead of the summit.

And Ecofin may also meet in the coming days to work on the details of whatever eurozone leaders agree on Wednesday night.

"Ministers of finance may meet in the coming days to fine-tune decisions that will be taken tomorrow," a spokesman for Herman Van Rompuy, the European Council president, said on Tuesday.

"There is no new summit planned."

By press time, the summit was still under way, and no details of the final comprehensive strategy were released.

Analysts said EU leaders weren't likely to quantify the increased firepower of the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) at Wednesday night's summit, and they may also not announce the amount of recapitalization for European banks, a person involved in the talks told the Wall Street Journal.

EU leaders were also to decide the scale of write-down on Greek debt.

The range of a write-down under discussion is between 40 and 60 percent, with Germany at the high end and France at the low.

Meanwhile, EU leaders are awaiting a letter from Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi setting out details on further reform measures amid concerns the country could suffer a Greek-style debt meltdown if it doesn't take swift action to control its debt.

As the G20 leaders are to meet on Nov 3 and 4 in France, EU leaders have been facing mounting pressures.

China hopes the EU takes effective measures to restore market confidence in tackling its debt crisis, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, while also again defending the yuan's exchange rate.

"I hope that the measures the EU adopts can effectively counter debt problems that some countries are facing and help in recovering market confidence and promote stability in Europe," ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said.

Euro deal reached, but crisis far from over

By Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff , Special to CNN

October 27, 2011 -- Updated 1929 GMT (0329 HKT)

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy attend an emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS

Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff says deal in emergency EU summit promising, crisis not over

He says Sarkozy, Merkel faced huge task in uniting eurozone leaders on plan for Greece

He says the markets are likely to poke holes in deal;

there's no telling what banks will do next

Writer:

The U.S. should come to rescue next and support upping IMF's financial involvement

Editor's note:

Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff is a Senior Transatlantic Fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Washington, D.C.

(CNN) -- Wednesday night's European summit was, well, a very European summit.

It lasted forever, included several dramatic moments, ended in the wee hours of the morning and delivered a highly complex result.

Yet, the questions that Americans might now ask are quite simple:

Has this leaders' conclave succeeded in stopping the spread of the "contagion" from the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis?

Will the European financial disease reach America's shores and affect local jobs and livelihoods?

The answer may seem somewhat paradoxical:

While the Europeans have made strides to beat the virus, this crisis is anything but over.

The Europeans had been asked to deploy a "big bazooka," a weapon so big and so potent that it would force financial markets into submission.

There could be no doubt allowed that the "euro-Europeans" (those who share Europe's single currency) would do absolutely everything to preserve the credibility of their currency and restore trust that investments in European bonds remain safe.

In the good old days, a president, a prime minister or a chancellor (most likely male) would have stepped up, made a bold decision and presented it to the people in front of a microphone.

He would appear to be determined and convinced that he was doing the right thing.

Doubt was neither part of his vocabulary nor his demeanor.

Indeed, those were the days of the sovereign nation state.

But the eurozone is not a sovereign and not a nation.

Instead of a prime minister, it has "Merkozy" -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- an odd couple who, though unelected in their roles, have stepped into a continental leadership vacuum.

Their summit battles with each other and with their 15 colleagues are well-known.

Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff

While the markets want certainty, Merkozy can only deliver measures saddled with national caveats because they must respect other nations' minority views.

It is the nature of Europe's intergovernmental beast that defies the decisiveness that markets demand.

Given the political constraints and the convoluted nature of the decision-making, Merkozy and friends have certainly delivered.

The complexity of the challenge in the uncharted territory of a monetary union without joint fiscal authority cannot be overstated.

Merkozy have lightened the debt load of Greece considerably by talking the banks into a loss of 50% on the face value of their Greek loans;

they have ring-fenced other weak nations by introducing a recapitalization mechanism for banks;

they have leveraged the existing bailout fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- to a maximum capacity of $ 1.4 trillion;

they have pressured Italy into another round of structural and budget reforms;

and they have agreed to improve the governance of the currency union by way of treaty change.

Not bad for a long weekend that ended Thursday morning.

The markets, after initially reacting favorably, will try to poke holes in the carefully constructed edifice.

The leaders themselves will have given the markets all the cues.

Such is the nature of a consensus body of national leaders that no disagreement and no doubt goes unnoticed, all preparatory documents -- including risk assessments -- have been leaked.

Soon, market participants will focus on the architecture of the leveraged bailout fund and its two new special-purpose vehicles, which will be open to outside investors.

It is still unknowable whether markets will consider them safe, given that the Europeans, especially the Germans, have insisted on insurance of limited rather than unlimited liability, to guarantee against some of the losses that bondholders might suffer.

Most importantly, the leaders cannot control what the banks do next.

They might seek new capital -- as is suggested to them -- to reach the new core capital requirement of 9% by next summer.

But they might also shrink their balance sheets to get there, thus contributing to a credit crunch and economic contraction.

Their participation in the Greek "haircut" has been framed as voluntary.

But in reality, at that level of a write-down, they are more interested in being forced into an agreement that the markets call a credit event.

Such an event triggers an insurance payment to the investors (an insurance scheme called credit default swap kicks in to minimize bank losses).

The European leaders want to avoid such a situation for risk of contagion.

It will still be quite a dance to avoid the credit event.

Again, the outcome is unknowable today.

In the end, markets might find that Europe's big bazooka is really mid-sized.

In fact, the last few days have revealed that the European firepower is limited.

France cannot spend much more cash without endangering the country's triple-A rating.

If it loses the top rating, the bailout fund will be downgraded as well, thus increasing Germany's liability.

At that point, the whole bailout building will look flimsy.

Therefore, it is time for others to come to the rescue.

Up until now, the United States has resisted increasing the International Monetary Fund's (and thus also America's) financial involvement.

But Washington will need to reconsider, for two reasons of self-interest:

The crisis spans the Atlantic, and the two economies are deeply integrated.

There will be no American recovery without stabilization in Europe.

Thursday morning, the French president talked to the Chinese premier to convince him to invest in Europe's new special-purpose vehicle.

Will America want to lose its leverage over Europe to China?

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff.

Euphoria surrounding euro-zone rescue may not last as detail scrutinised

As is often the case following an EU summit, markets are rallying on the back of various agreements and firm commitments.

However, the devil is in the detail, and the euphoria surrounding this agreement reached at 4am may not survive when exposed to the cold light of day over the coming weeks and months.

EU policymakers agreed the following key measures:

Europe’s banks would have to raise €106bn of additional capital by the end of June next year.

In the first instance they should try to raise capital privately, including by converting debt to equity, then via their national government and finally via Europe’s bailout fund, the EFSF.

Banks will take a ‘haircut’ of 50% from the value of their Greek debt holdings, a significant increase on the 21% haircut agreed at the 21 July summit.

Crucially, banks have agreed to this through their international body the IIF, suggesting the haircut is voluntary and therefore would not be considered a credit event that would trigger payment from credit default swaps on Greek debt.

Greece will also receive €130bn in aid as part of this debt restructuring, €30bn more than agreed on 21 July.

The EFSF will be increased to €1 trillion through leverage - most likely in the form of insurance against losses on a portion of new euro-zone bond issuance and a special-purpose vehicle that will be allowed to raise extra funds by commercial paper, a form of short term debt.

In addition, the European Union will attempt to raise further funds for the EFSF through the International Monetary Fund or foreign contributors, specifically China and other sovereign wealth funds.

French President Sarkozy is due to speak with the Chinese premier today, and EFSF head Klaus Regling meets with Chinese officials on Friday.

There was a specific focus on Italy - encouraging it to accelerate labour-market and pension reforms and liberalise services.

The European Commission will provide a detailed assessment of measures and monitor implementation.

Progress towards some form of fiscal union including modest EU treaty changes if necessary, and ability to view and authorise national fiscal policies for countries in excessive deficit procedures.

Another important development was yesterday’s statement from incoming European Central Bank (ECB) President Draghi that the ECB remains “determined to avoid a poor functioning of monetary and financial markets.” This has been interpreted to mean that the ECB will continue to intervene in European sovereign bond markets at least until the EFSF is funded and operational, buying Italian and Spanish debt in particular to prevent their yields from spiking too high.

Taken collectively, these measures are encouraging, and go a long way in meeting criteria we have set out previously that need to be achieved to stabilise the European fiscal crisis.

Nevertheless, many of the announcements are simply commitments at this stage, and in many cases the details have yet to be implemented or, indeed, agreed.

For example, the details on how the EFSF will be leveraged have yet to be determined.

It is likely to involve using EFSF funds to insure a portion (20-25%) of new debt issuance by euro-zone governments.

However, this will increase contingent claims on all euro-zone governments and therefore could endanger their own sovereign ratings over time.

If France in particular were to be downgraded, then the EFSF would likely also loose its AAA rating, endangering the whole project.

Insuring a portion of newly issued European sovereign debt also risks creating a twotier market between old and newly issued sovereign debt.

Political risk in Greece and Italy also remains high.

Commitments to fiscal consolidation are yet to be implemented in Italy in particular.

What’s more, leading indicators show the euro-zone economy is slipping into recession, suggesting fiscal consolidation will be even harder to achieve next year for all the euro-zone countries.

For now, markets are likely to ignore the lack of detail and focus on the impressive headline numbers such as the commitment to leverage up the EFSF to €1trn.

The hint by incoming ECB President Draghi of continued euro-zone sovereign-bond purchases is also likely to be behind the improvement in market sentiment.

However, substantial risks remain in the medium-term, especially with the euro-zone economy slipping into recession and given substantial political uncertainty.

Implementation risk also remains high.

What looked good at 4am on a rainy morning in Brussels may be less palatable as the details are more closely scrutinised over time.

But while the plan gave observers and global financial markets reason for cautious optimism, the measures' success will turn on the specifics.

“This is a big step in the right direction,” says Thomas Huertas, former head of European Banking Authority.

“The details, though, will have to be worked out now by finance ministers, regulatory authorities, and the banks.”

A brief history of the Greek debt crisis

Bold numbers

Europe's leaders had to find agreement on three main issues to overcome the worst crisis in over 60 years:

To increase significantly the firepower of the eurozone’s bailout fund, the EFSF;

to involve private creditors in the restructuring of Greek debt to a much higher degree than previously planned;

and to persuade European banks to accept an unpopular recapitalization program designed to enable them to withstand future write-offs of sovereign debt within the eurozone.

On the face of it, Europe’s leaders came up with bold numbers.

Banks and other private creditors agreed to write off 50 percent of Greece ’s debt – worth about 100 billion euros ($140 billion).

This should help Greece to decrease its debt rate from 160 percent now to 120 percent in the year 2020.

On top of that, the country will receive another 100 billion euros in loans from European institutions within the next three years.

“The whole exercise of the summit was to bring credibility and stability back into the system,” says Ulrike Guerot, senior research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

“They held 14 summits since the beginning of the crisis and not one of them managed to convince the markets.

So this time they had to be bold.”

European debt crisis:

Seven basics you need to know

To prevent banks from coming under pressure themselves when writing off a portion of the debt of Greece or other potential candidates, the EU has asked them to increase their rate of capital resources from currently four to nine percent.

According to the European Banking Authority they have to raise 106 billion euros, which they are supposed to get at financial markets.

If the banks are unable to raise the capital, they can turn to national governments for help, and as a last resort to the eurozone bailout fund, the EFSF.

The fund’s capacity to help banks and governments has been increased, not by putting more money into it, but through so-called leverage, achieved by a combination of two things.

One is insurance:

Rather than buy government bonds of ailing countries, the fund guarantees parts, maybe 20 percent, of the bonds, thus using the existing amount of the fund’s 440 billions euros ($610 billion) to entice five times as many investors to buy them.

The second part of the leveraging mechanism consists of so-called special purpose vehicles, allowing a wider range of investors, including state-owned funds, to buy government bonds.

All in all, this should boost the EFSF’s capacity to 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion).

Cautious optimism

The markets seem to indicate support for the plan.

The euro strengthened and stocks rose at Asian and European markets in reaction to the summit’s results.

“This is good news, but far from crisis over,” says James Ashley, Senior Europe Economist at RBC Capital Markets in London . “Particularly on boosting the EFSF we don’t have full disclosure yet of how that is supposed to work, so we are waiting to see the fine print.”

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou chose to see the big picture, saying:

"We can claim that a new day has come for Greece, and not only for Greece but also for Europe."

All eyes are now on Italy , which has come into the focus of rating agencies lately, sitting on 1.9 trillion euros ($2.7 trillion) of debt.

The government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been reluctant to introduce reforms.

Only under pressure from his eurozone colleagues, Mr. Berlusconi promised measures like raising the retirement age to 67 by 2025 and presenting a balanced budget by 2013.

The European Union has reached a deal that will see banks take a loss of 50 per cent on Greek bonds they have purchased -- an important step toward defusing the eurozone's debt crisis.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed the agreement at a press conference early Thursday after a marathon emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.

"The result will relieve the whole world that was expecting a decision that was strong from the eurozone," French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters at news conference, according to the BBC.

The assembled leaders also agreed to force Europe's major banks to raise $148 billion in an effort to strengthen them ahead of the expected losses on Greece's debt, and made headway toward a third agreement that would boost a joint bailout fund to $1.4 trillion.

The larger bailout fund is supposed to help keep Greece's debt -- which is expected to hit 180 percent of its economic output -- from enveloping larger countries including Italy and Spain.

EU leaders have been under incredible pressure to get the two-year-old debt crisis under control, following a number of delays and lackluster solutions.

The slow pace of progress has taken its toll on financial markets, stoking fears among investors that the crisis could lead to a recession across much of the developed world.

Financial leaders the world over have been watching the EU negotiations with concern.

Outside the summit, British Prime Minister David Cameron reassured reporters on Tuesday that "good progress" was being made toward dealing with the situation.

In Ottawa, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said Wednesday he expects the EU will move incrementally toward ending the debt crisis.

"We are confident that the European authorities understand the severity of the situation," he told reporters.

"We're also confident they understand the type of measures that need to be put in place."

However, Carney added that he does not expect that "the decisions of this week or next week or the following month in Europe are going to instantly solve all of the problems of the monetary union."

For now, he said the BoC is concerned about whether European leaders will be able to contain the situation if it worsens, or whether debt problems could spread to North America and other parts of the globe.

Tory rebels trying to claw back power handed to Brussels won't get their way while I'm in power, crows Clegg

So what on earth is going on?

Why is the single currency in such a mess?

What are its leaders going to do about it?

Can the euro be saved?

Will it be?

And what does it all mean for us here in the UK?

These are questions that would take far more space and time to answer in depth than I have in a single article.

Not all of them are answerable in simple terms, as events are unpredictable and we are in uncharted territory.

But in the interests of a helping hand to readers who are understandably perplexed by the whole nightmare, here goes.

In essence, the singe currency is in a mess because of a basic design flaw.

Enlarge  

Fraught relations:

German chancellor Angela Merkel, left, and Nicolas Sarkozy, right

Currency unions can and do work - think of the United States, where the mighty dollar is the common currency across all the states - but they have only functioned smoothly where there is already political union.

In the case of Europe, after the Second World War and the fall of the Berlin Wall, there was a huge desire for peace and unity, along with the hope that a single European trading entity could take on the economic might of the US and emerging Asian nations.

A currency union was seen as a big step on that route, and it was simply assumed political union would naturally ensue.

It didn't.

The euro handcuffed together a group of very different economies.

Countries such as Greece had the benefit of low interest rates tailored to prudent and prosperous Germans, and lived beyond their means.

But because of the overwhelming belief in the project on the part of the Franco-German political classes, and because there was monetary union without fiscal union - or some central control over how member nations spent their money - a blind eye was turned to all of this, until the financial crisis meant it could be ignored no longer.

What are Europe's political leaders going to do about it?

Well, there are three prongs to their plan, which I will take in ascending order of improbability.

The first is a plan to boost the capital of banks that might be hit by losses on Greek debt.

This seems to have been agreed in principle, as there is a consensus that European banks need to raise around 110bn of new capital, initially from their shareholders, and if investors refuse to step up to the plate, from governments.

The idea is that they should have a bigger buffer of capital so they are capable of absorbing any losses.

If the governments do not have the money to pump into banks either - and some in the eurozone certainly don't - then the European Financial Stability Facility, of which more below, will have to step in.

The second element is to agree how much of a loss Greece's lenders will be forced to take - known colloquially as a haircut.

Should it be just a little trim, or a brutal buzz cut?

There is a general acceptance that Athens cannot pay back what it owes, but disagreement on how much of those losses creditors should be made to accept.

The French don't want to take too much of a haircut, because their banks were the biggest lenders.

The third, and most contentious part of a deal, is the shape of the European Financial Stability Facility, the eurozone's lifeboat.

Everyone agrees it isn't big enough.

With only 440billion euros, it would be sunk if it had to deal with big economies such as Spain and Italy.

Just making it bigger is not on politically, as this would involve raising the guarantees provided by member governments, with Germany, the biggest contributor, being on the hook for the most money.

The French mooted a proposal that the EFSF should be able to borrow from the European Central Bank, but that idea has been blocked by Germany.

In theory, the European Central Bank could just get its printing presses rolling, and supply as much as is needed - but the Germans would never stand for it.

So can the euro be saved?

Theoretically, yes - Europe as a whole is not a basket case, but having chained themselves together, the eurozone nations are only as strong as their weakest link.

The problem for the political leaders is that the ordinary people, the electorates, have never been as keen as the elites on the whole idea and are unlikely to stomach greater fiscal union.

What does it mean to the UK?

Whatever happens, it doesn't look good

For strong countries like Germany, that would involve more vast transfers from prudent taxpaying burghers in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf to struggling nations, and they don't see why they should carry on putting the hands in the pocket of their Lederhosen.

For weak countries like Greece, the idea of submitting their national economic affairs to the direction of the Germans is equally unpalatable.

What does it mean to the UK?

Almost whatever happens, it's not good news.

Sadly, we cannot nod our heads sympathetically and thank our lucky stars we didn't get involved.

It is very fortunate indeed we did not join the single currency but we are still affected by the eurozone turmoil, as it is our biggest trading partner.

UK banks have a relatively small exposure to Greek debt, and British taxpayers are not on the hook to back the EFSF.

However, we would be contribute to any support given through the International Monetary Fund, through our levies to that institutions.

Where will it all end?

There may possibly be imaginative solutions that are getting lost in the political wrangling, such as a Marshall-style plan to boost growth and competitiveness in nations such as Greece and Italy.

Again, though, these would have to be paid for, largely by the Germans.

China and rich emerging nations like Brazil might come up with some money - but on what conditions?

Barring a miracle, the single currency looks to be unravelling, and the consequences of that are unknowable.

Opponents of the euro project always feared it would, and can only look on in sadness at the increasingly difficult plight of our European neighbours, who were seduced by their own political dream.

Looking at the stock markets this morning, it might be tempting to believe the latest summit of Eurozone leaders had actually come up with a solution.

Not a bit of it. The latest crunch summit, billed like all its predecessors as make or break for the single currency, is the seventh this year and more will follow.

Call me Mystic Meg, but I have no doubt the G20 meetings scheduled for November in Cannes will be advertised in the same fashion.

Here we go again:

Wednesday night's summit was the seventh this year

So what has actually been agreed, and will it work?

Well, European leaders came up with an emergency three-pronged deal, after protracted jaw-jaw into the small hours.

The first part is Greek debt:

banks holding this will write off half of their holdings.

Although the banks were reluctant to take this ‘haircut’, this is the outcome the markets expected.

It will reduce Greece’s debt burden.

What it doesn’t do is address the lack of competitiveness of the Greek economy.

The second bit is that European banks will be asked to pull in around 106bn euros of fresh capital to build up their reserves, so they are better able to withstand any losses from sovereign debt.

This was pretty well-flagged too.

In the first place, the banks will try to raise this money from investors, who may be a tad reluctant. 

This has been billed as a banking bailout, but it isn’t.

The banks are expected to find the fresh capital and to bear the cost of the Greek writedowns themselves.

The consequence of this might be reduced lending, as they attempt to hoard reserves, which would act as a brake on growth.

They may woo Chinese or Middle Eastern investors, but they would be likely to exact tough conditions.

Relief:

The deal does at least buy leaders breathing space from market speculators

The third prong is that the main Eurozone bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, is to be beefed up from 440bn euros to around 1trn.

At the moment, there is around 250bn left available in the EFSF and this will be expanded under a new framework, including risk insurance, and special types of investment aimed at attracting support from China and other rich states.

We don’t have any detail, and are unlikely to until the end of November at the earliest.

Does any of this help?

Well yes, in the sense that it is better than nothing, and it does appear to have bought the Eurozone a breathing space from the market speculators.

I have rehearsed the underlying problems for the single currency area in this blog several times already, so I won’t go over old ground.

Confidence:

The main aim is to persuade businesses and markets to invest

There is a key point to add here, though, and it is about confidence.

The main aim of this emergency summit and the ones that went before is not to get  the small print right for the EFSF it is to instil that elusive sense of confidence, in the markets and in businesses, so they will resume investment.

But the Eurozone elite has so far been incapable of this.

It is not because they are defective as human beings, as politicians or as leaders, though some are all three.

It is because there is no-one who can stamp his – or her – authority on the situation.

Mrs Merkel needs a mandate from the German parliament before she can agree to anything substantive, and has to soothe an increasingly angry electorate.

The Eurozone is at the moment unruly and could become ungovernable.

Anyway, I am conscious that this blog is not the sunniest read on the site, so in the interests of cheering up those who have read this far, it’s a testament to City resilience that there is no economic situation too horrible to turn into a joke.

Here are a few doing the rounds:

Q:

Why did Greece fail to get the latest instalment of EU/IMF aid?

A:  Because no one in Greece works long enough to complete the application form.        

Q:

A Greek, an Irishman and a Portuguese go into a bar and order a drink.

Who pays?

A:

The German.

From a German website:  'For 400 euros you can adopt a Greek.

He'll stay at your place, sleep late, drink coffee, have lunch and then take a nap, so you can go to work.'

Q:

How do you know it's going to be a double-dip recession?        

A:

Exports of taramosalata and tzatziki have plunged.

An old one, with thanks to Louise Cooper of BCG Capital.

Sir Humphrey Appleby:

Minister, Britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last 500 years:

to create a disunited Europe.

In that cause we have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians.

Divide and rule, you see. Why should we change now, when it's worked so well?

James Hacker:

That's all ancient history, surely.

Sir Humphrey Appleby:

Yes, and current policy.

We had to break the whole thing up, so we had to get inside.

We tried to break it up from the outside, but that wouldn't work.

Now that we're inside we can make a complete pig's breakfast of the whole thing:

set the Germans against the French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch.

The Foreign Office is terribly pleased;

it's just like old times.

James Hacker:

Surely we're all committed to the European ideal.

Sir Humphrey Appleby:

Really, Minister.

[laughs]

James Hacker:

If not, why are we pushing for an increase in the membership?

Sir Humphrey Appleby:

Well, for the same reason.

It's just like the United Nations, in fact.

The more members it has, the more arguments it can stir up. The more futile and impotent it becomes.

James Hacker:

What appalling cynicism.

Sir Humphrey Appleby:

Yes. We call it diplomacy, Minister.

And finally, one for disco fans, from the Wall Street Journal website.

I Will Delay (from Angela Merkel:

The Disco Years) – to the tune of I will survive

First I was angstvoll, I was petrified

Greece looking like defaulting, Ireland on the slide

I spent oh so many years with the euro much too strong

Now it’s not even clear, which countries should belong

And so we’re back

At the Council

With Nicolas, and Enda, and Silvio as well

We should have tightened up the rulebook

For the single currency

If we’d known for just one second

We’d fund this facility

Go on now go, down to Brussels

We’ll fly over and talk some more, while the market sells

They want a big bazooka, a comprehensive fix,

An ECB-backed bailout fund, but we’ll give them nix.

It’s all okay!

We can delay!

We’ll have a weekend summit

And another one Wednesday

There’s a G-20 coming up

For the Greeks it’s just tough luck

Let’s just delay

EU agrees on 50-% Greek debt write-down, $1.4 billion rescue fund news

27 October 2011

European leaders have sealed a deal with euro zone banks to write down 50 per cent of their Greek debt holdings even as the 17-nation block pledged to raise their rescue fund to 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion), in a bid to revitalise Europe and ease the pain of the global economy.

The deal will help reduce 100 billion from the 350-billion Greek debt pile while offering it a 100-billion loan over the next three years.

This will reduce effective debt of the troubled nation to around 150 billion.

The 10-hour-long Brussels summit intended to break the deadlock, however, has not worked out finer details of the rescue package.

"We took important decisions," EU president Herman Van Rompuy stated at the end of talks.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy closed ranks to strike a deal with the head of the EU banking lobby Charles Dallara.

While some details of the deal are yet to be worked out, Merkel said, a comprehensive package to avert the escalation of the crisis will be ready when the EU leaders convene again in three days.

German parliament passes EU bailout bill ahead of crucial summit

 

One month after a rebellion within her own party's ranks over the eurozone bailout fund, Chancellor Angela Merkel has convinced a broad political coalition to give her more power in negotiating the fund's expansion.

 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday secured a broad parliamentary majority on the expansion of the eurozone's bailout fund, shortly after describing the escalating eurozone debt crisis as Europe's most difficult hour since World War II.

"What is good for Europe is also good for Germany," Merkel said before the vote in the German parliament, the Bundestag.

"If the euro fails, then Europe fails and that cannot happen."

In an address to parliament, Merkel called on the chamber to support changes to the EU's treaties that would allow Brussels to intervene in the budgets of states who constantly break agreed upon fiscal rules.

 The Bundestag supported Merkel despite growing criticism After her speech, lawmakers voted 503-89 to approve two methods of leveraging the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), a 440-billion-euro ($557 billion) bailout fund for the 17 nations that use the common euro currency.

Risks are worth it

Although leveraging the European bailout fund would carry additional risks, the chancellor said there was no other alternative to bring Europe back from the financial brink.

"It would not be justifiable to not take on the risk," said Merkel.

Despite growing criticism from within the ranks of Merkel's center-right coalition government, the passage of the resolution came with the support of the opposition Social Democrats and Greens. The Left party voted against it.

But the "yes" votes from the opposition did not come without criticism of the government's handling of the crisis in the past year.

Frank-Walter Steinmeier, parliamentary leader of the Social Democrats, said issues like bank recapitalization and writing down Greek debt had been brought forward by his party some time ago.

"I would like to have heard many of these statements a year ago," Steinmeier said.

After the vote, Merkel was scheduled to fly to Brussels for the final installment of a three-day marathon summit on Europe's escalating debt crisis.

The heads of Europe's states and governments are to continue hashing out the details of a debt write-down for Greece, the recapitalization of banks and the leveraging of the bailout fund.

 Steinmeier criticized Merkel's government, while still voting to give her authority Leveraging the expansion

During the last European summit in July, the continent's leaders expanded the temporary EFSF to its current size of 440 billion euros.

The controversial expansion, however, has proven inadequate due to the dismal financial state of Greece and the instable fiscal situations in Italy and Spain, the eurozone's third and fourth-largest economies respectively.

For Athens to get back on a fiscally stable footing, European leaders are likely to call on private banks to write off up to 60 percent of their holdings in Greek government bonds, which could trigger a banking crisis.

Tremors within Europe's banking sector coupled with instability in Italy and Spain could quickly exhaust the EFSF's funds.

Unwilling to expand the EFSF with more taxpayers' money, Merkel's government has suggested partially insuring the purchase of risky government bonds - such as those of Greece - by private investors.

Some members of Merkel's own coalition, however, are skeptical of the move and have expressed concerns that leveraging the fund would - in the end - expose Germany to further risk and jeopardize its credit rating.

Frank Schäffler, a representative with Merkel's coalition partners the Free Democrats, expressed concern that the proposed solutions will only exacerbate the fundamental problems driving the debt crisis.

"What the heads of state and government are now discussing is what caused the global financial crisis in the first place," Schäffler said.

Germany only country to need parliamentary approval for bailout

 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has won the backing of the Bundestag on boosting the EU bailout fund hours before a crucial summit.

Although the vote increases transparency, it complicates the mission in Brussels.

 

Ahead of the crucial EU summit in Brussels German Chancellor Angela Merkel put the additional German financial commitments to the EU bailout fund to a vote in the Bundestag on Wednesday, winning a broad approval of 503-89.

But the chancellor was the only eurozone leader who was obliged to seek parliamentary approval.

This unique requirement was decided in a landmark ruling from Germany's Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe last month.

Concerned that the opinions of German delegates were falling by the wayside, it decided parliament must have a greater say in future EU bailout packages.

The judges ruled that Germany's elected representatives must retain control over the fundamental budgetary decisions.

A parliamentary budget committee was chosen to manage this difficult task on a day-to-day basis.

But in light of the new risks which could face Germany as the main guarantor of the European rescue package, the opposition in Berlin have demanded that all the details are made public as soon as possible.

Out in the open

According to Merkel, the main public role of the Bundestag was to debate how Brussels will handle the proposed miraculous boost to the rescue fund without the German taxpayer having to contribute to more than the 211 million euros already approved in parliament.

This public debate was spearheaded by the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens.

Not long ago the government insisted on its intention that the budgetary committee should handle the thorny issue internally, but then the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Free Democrats (FDP) relented.

"The government doesn't want to appear as if guarantees were already being manipulated and boosted to astronomical proportions in secret, in some tiny backroom of the Reichstag," suggested the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.

Bildunterschrift:

The constitutional court strengthened the power of the Bundestag in the EU rescue deal

Blank check?

Indeed skepticism in Germany is likely to increase if it appears there is a lack of transparency as one rescue package follows another within a year and half, with no end in sight.

With her agreement for an open debate and a vote in parliament, Merkel opened the door for the opposition SPD and the Greens to continue loudly criticizing the government, yet also made it easier for them to agree to the expansion of the EFSF "out of responsibility to Europe."

Even renewed success at home in the Bundestag does not give Merkel a free hand during negotiations in Brussels.

She must adapt her position to what has been decided in parliament.

Unauthorized overruns to Germany's contribution to the rescue package could be a problem, and anything decided in Brussels on Wednesday must still be put to parliament in two weeks' time.

EU leaders burn midnight oil at marathon debt summit

 

Europe's top politicians and banking officials have worked through the night in Brussels, seeking a string of deals on Greece, sovereign debt and bank recapitalization.

A plan with at least three prongs has emerged.

 

It was 4 a.m. Thursday in Brussels when French President Nicolas Sarkozy stepped up and began to detail the outcomes of a hard night's haggling.

The sticking point that had slowed proceedings most dramatically appeared to be a deal under which banks would accept a 50 percent loss on their investments in Greek sovereign bonds.

Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had held face-to-face talks with leading banking industry representatives in the early hours of the morning as progress on this front faltered.

"[German Chancellor Angela] Merkel and I have been in contact with representatives of the bankers - not to negotiate, but to inform them of the decisions of the 17 eurozone members," Sarkozy told reporters.

"They themselves reflected on this and gave their consent."

This banking deal, however, is still officially voluntary, meaning private lenders will have to agree to it individually.

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou hailed this debt write-off as the start of a "new era" for Greece.

The French president went on to say that Europe's leaders had agreed to a "three-pronged plan" to tackle its sovereign debt woes.

Besides the deal on Greek debt with private sector banks, leaders agreed to boost the theoretical size of the bloc's rainy-day fund - the European Financial Stability Facility - to roughly 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion), and to mandate that banks across the continent increase their capital reserves by 106 billion euros so as to better shield them from market volatility.

Sarkozy said that the world was expecting decisive action from the summit, and that he thought the agreements reached in the early hours of Thursday in Brussels would satisfy these demands.

The world was watching

"These are exceptional measures for exceptional times.

Europe must never again find itself in this situation, this is why we must further improve our economic governance," European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said after the meetings.

Chancellor Merkel, who also highlighted the importance of more closely coordinated and stringently supervised economic governance, said after the marathon summit that the deals showed how European leaders could "draw the right conclusions" as they seek to combat the bloc's debt problems.

"I am very aware that the world was watching these debates today," the chancellor said, also praising the banks for their readiness to contribute to attempts to reduce Greece's untenable levels of debt.

She said they were now "substantial" participants in efforts to bring the country from the brink of bankruptcy.

Sarkozy and Merkel both estimated that banks would write off roughly 100 billion euros as part of this agreement, which will affect all European lenders, including those in Greece.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking earlier in the night on the sidelines of the summit, had highlighted the importance of the deal to recapitalize the bloc's banks, saying it was very important to countries outside the eurozone that the fragile banking sector was stabilized.

The European single currency, the euro, reacted positively in trading on Asian markets shortly after the conclusion of the summit.

EU leaders agree haircut for Greece after marathon summit

 

The expectations from the two EU summits in the past four days were high.

But on Thursday - after a long, long night of negotiations the leaders have come out with a handful of concrete results.

 

"The world was watching and we showed it that we have come to the right decisions," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel as results of Wednesday night's marathon summit broke just before dawn.

Greece will get its debt cut - but that is not all.  

The aim was a complete package to solve the euro debt crisis - a debt cut for Greece, the expansion of the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), the basis for all bailout plans, and a strong shot in the arm for banks.

And the message - addressed to financial markets, investors and EU nations themselves - was that Europe will protect its member states threatened as they are by the growing crisis.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy stressed how important the decisions were as he explained that the complex and necessary topics had led to very long negotiations.

"But I believe the results will bring relief to the world, which has waited for tough decisions from the eurozone," Sarkozy said.

Sarkozy offers 'relief' to the world

That relief was felt on markets soon after the leaders' announcement, with world stocks and the euro rising to their highest levels in nearly two months.

Frankfurt's DAX was up 3.5 percent and France's benchmark CAC 40 index climbed by 4 percent. Asian stocks also rose on the positive news.

The euro climbed above $1.40 for the first time since September.

But the road to Thursday's result was rough.

As the negotiations dragged on into the early hours of the morning it was the haircut for Greece that proved the biggest problem.

Greek representatives debated hard with bank representatives from the banks' umbrella body, Institute of International Finance (IIF), while next door EU state and government heads sat together, asking themselves whether there should be a debt cut for Greece, how high it should be, and under which conditions.

The banks tried to fight off the prospect of a debt cut and the related losses through the night.

 Merkel and IMF chief Christine Lagarde raised the pressure

Raising the pressure on the banks, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President Herman van Rompuy and the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, stepped up to the marathon negotiations.

To do it, the actual EU summit was interrupted.

Then, in the early hours of the morning - at around 3:30 a.m. - came the breakthrough.

Finally, the banks agreed to write off 50 percent of Greek debt - roughly 100 billion euros ($140 billion).

It will reduce Greece's overall debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product.

It is currently running between 160 and 170 percent.

But the banks' pledge is voluntary, and some analysts say it may not happen at all.

A lever for the EFSF

EU leaders were also able to expand the EFSF.

Its power will grow to almost a trillion euros from its current level of 440 billion.

But it has yet to be decided how this "lever" will be achieved.

One option for the lever would be to establish a form of partially comprehensive insurance.

That would mean that when investors buy government bonds (or loans), the EFSF would cover 20 percent of the risk.

The other option would be to establish one or more funds using EFSF bonds and private contributions.

With their help, it would be possible to mobilize more money on the markets.

It is also possible that leaders could pick a mix-and-match option - and this is where China comes in to the equation.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy is due to meet the Chinese President Hu Jintao about a possible contribution to the EFSF lever from Beijing.

Buffer for the banks

All 27 EU member states have agreed to force banks to raise their core capital quotas - also known as Tier 1 Ratings - to nine percent by 2012. They are talking about an extra 106 billion euros in capital.

The core capital quota refers to the balance of a bank's capital against the loans and investments it has made.

It is hoped this move would protect banks against possible new crises in larger EU countries.

Italy under pressure

 Berlusconi has been through the ring

Italy is one of the countries where the crisis could still spread.

Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has announced a number of reforms, but has done little to make them a reality.

But under pressure from other leaders at the EU summit over the weekend, Berlusconi returned to Brussels on Wednesday with a new promise of reform.

In a letter to the members of the EU summit, Berlusconi pledged to deliver a plan by November 15 to include adjustments in Italy's job market, pension program, and privatization plans.

Berlusconi's outline of a plan also aims to improve conditions for business through less bureaucracy and modern organization.

His plan made a good impression, according to Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

But the last few days appear to have left their mark on Berlusconi, who faces ongoing speculation about his departure.

European press review:

The debt crisis is far from over

 

European editorial writers have largely welcomed the outcome of Wednesday's crucial EU summit.

But many have warned that a Greek debt haircut may not be enough to solve Europe's spiraling financial crisis.

 

Eurozone leaders proclaimed a “comprehensive and solid” response to the European debt crisis early on Thursday morning, but Europe's press is reluctant to hail the latest deal.

Many warn that more action is needed to control the spiraling debt crisis.

The German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung praises Europe's leaders for coming up with a unified and "comprehensive" rescue package, but warns that many issues still need to be addressed.

"Many market experts believe it is too early to proclaim that there has been a breakthrough," Süddeutsche says.

"They believe there are simply too many questions left unanswered.

The actual contribution of the banks is, for example, still unclear … The European rescue funds' leverage remains incomplete and its success is far from certain."

The left-wing Spanish newspaper El Pais is more damning in its praise of the eurozone leaders' achievements.

It writes that contrary to expectations, the EU summit found no sustainable answers to the financial crisis.

It suggests that the decision's taken by EU leaders were "lean" given the delicacy of Europe's financial situation.

"The biggest danger doesn't come from Greece anymore, it comes from Italy.

The likelihood is that the weaknesses of the Berlusconi government will mean that Rome can no longer repay its debts.

There are no funds available to rescue Italy."

The liberal Italian newspaper La Stampa also expresses concern over Italy's handling of the financial crisis.

It argues that now is the time that Italy should reassert itself in Europe.

"Now more than ever, Italy should bring its national sovereignty to the forefront… Italy's weaknesses come from the parliamentary deadlock and its political impotence.

Only an injection of courage and a new political mentality can help us out of this crisis and allow us to win back our sovereignty," it says.

As the Italian press bemoans Italy's loss of sovereignty, several European newspapers comment on the influence Germany has wielded over the debt deal.

The French conservative daily Le Figaro says that Merkel's insistence that German prosperity depends on the survival of the eurozone and the support she received in parliament proves how committed Germany is to Europe.

It highlights, however, that Germany is no longer tarred by the legacy of the Second World War and taking a backseat in European affairs.

"As of now, Europe will have to take into account Germany's priorities more than ever - above all budget discipline, which Berlin views as having run out of control in Europe since the Greek crisis."

Zurich's daily Tages- Anzeiger also refers to Germany's position as a key player in eurozone negotiations.

It comments on the fact the German chancellor was the only eurozone leader who was obliged to seek parliamentary approval ahead of the EU summit.

"While the Arab world experienced its democratic spring, it appears the European Union is trying to push ahead with its own democratic autumn," it says.

"How else can we look at the unique process through which the German Chancellor, before one of the most important summits in the EU's history, had to consult her own parliament?

This has never happened before."

Opinion:

Merkel perseveres at EU debt talks, surprises doubters

 

Emerging from a long night of EU debt crisis talks in Brussels, Angela Merkel said she was happy with her work.

Unsurprisingly, given that the German Chancellor prevailed against many doubters.

 

On the day after the EU summit, well-meaning comments resound in Berlin, along the lines that the chancellor has done a good job and the package agreed is coherent.

Most of the encouragement comes not surprisingly from her conservative, pro-business coalition:

to stabilize the euro Merkel had exercised leadership qualities and Berlin's point of view had largely prevailed.

Mixed in with that praise is a sense of relief.

Remember the past months?

At home and abroad in Europe, Merkel was accused of hesitating and dithering.

Not only skeptics had prophesied that little could be expected from the second debt crisis summit in Brussels.

Bildunterschrift:

Sabine Kinkartz is DW's Economics CorrespondentNow, there are quite a few people rubbing their eyes in disbelief.

Overnight, decisions were made on measures that in previous weeks and months had been contentious and regarded as unenforceable.

Half of Greece's debts are to be written off and the private sector, meaning the banks and insurance companies, must participate in this debt cancellation.

If they do not manage it, national state assistance must be provided before Europe steps in with its bailout fund.

The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) will not, however, be given a banking license as the French had fought for.  Assistance for indebted nations shall only be provided in future under strict conditions;

time limits are to be negotiated for state austerity schemes and reforms involving, for example, Italy.  European treaties are to be changed, preferably quickly.

Was Germany the decision-maker?

But was all this the work of the German chancellor?

Romano Prodi, the former president of the European Commission, is said to have once said that "the lady makes the decisions and the French president then gives a press conference to pronounce those decisions."

Sure, Germany is the strongest economy in Europe and Germany bears the brunt of the financial burden in this debt crisis.

But that alone cannot be the reason for the results of the long night in Brussels.

In Berlin, the outcome is being put down to luck, pure and simple.

On October 19, French President Nicholas Sarkozy made a surprise trip to Frankfurt to join talks.

That was followed by a series of small-scale meetings, which had not even been planned, but were efficient and fruitful.

So, at the subsequent summit on Wednesday night, the various strands could be woven together, leading to a this deal.

One of these small-scale meetings was the so-called "Frankfurt round."

The official farewell for European Central Bank President, Jean-Claude Trichet, led to the first-ever joint encounter of Chancellor Merkel, the French President, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde, EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy, EU Commission President José Manuel Barroso and, of course, Trichet.

Sarkozy had intended to make a sudden appearance, while his wife was in Paris giving birth, to emotionally outmaneuver Merkel.

But, the chancellor was neither amused nor fazed.

Sarkozy should have known that.

When Merkel has made up her mind, she can hardly be swayed.

Some describe her manner as stoical.

On the outside she appears quiet, under control, and inconspicuous, with an icy smile.

She is undeterred and always perseveres, she has nerves of steel. 

Not many people can honestly say they can cope with just four or five hours of sleep per night or even do without it altogether if push comes to shove.

That ability must have helped Merkel clinch success through the night from Wednesday into Thursday.

During the tough negotiations with the banks, she and Sarkozy intervened personally along with the heads of the EU institutions. 

"We only made one single offer," Merkel said later.

"That was our last word."

It might sound as though Merkel simply couldn't be bothered to carry on negotiating.

The chancellor would probably say otherwise.

The trained physicist once said that trends must have time to mature before one can make a decision. That's the scientist in her. Running serial experiments requires a lot of patience, analytical skills and the feeling for the moment when it is time to finish the tests.

In Brussels, her experiment has definitely worked.

Your feedback

The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has walked into the EU summit in Brussels with a strong mandate from German MPs in the Bundestag.  The Bundestag backed Merkel’s proposals to increase the firepower of the EFSF and also want private sector to share a significant loss in the case of a managed Greek bailout.

The German Parliament backed Ms. Merkel’s motion by 503-89, with four abstentions.

Although the government won the vote, like Cameron, Ms. Merkel has a problem with her backbenchers.

The majority of the no votes came from Merkel’s own coalition MPs.   Many MPs within her coalition was angered by what they felt was a veneer of consultation although Ms. Merkel was taking all the big decisions unilaterally.

"The resolution was a smokescreen," said Frank Schäffler, a rebel MP. “"It was the right decision to let parliament vote on it, but the thing is that we weren't voting on the detailed guidelines but a vague resolution.”  

But undoubtedly this strengthens the hand of the leader of Europe’s biggest economy which would have to shell out bulk of the bailout money.  She has drawn a line in the sand and has told her MPs that Germany is not going to provide any further bailout, and she also wants to drop the French plan to have the European Central Bank play a key role in acting as a guarantor.

This is the traditional German position for over six decades where the central bank is independent and its key job is to control inflation not bailout debt laden states.  However, today, not only the French but also David Cameron urged Merkel to drop her opposition to the involvement of the ECB.

The focus on the role of the European Central Bank means that the British government has little hope that today’s summit would deliver a long lasting and comprehensive solution to the EU debt crisis.

Earlier, Ms. Merkel told the Bundestag that if the euro fails then Europe fails which would lead to political and economic instability across Europe.

The world is watching Europe and Germany;

it is watching whether we are ready and able, in the hour of Europe's most serious crisis since the end of World War II, to take responsibility," Merkel told parliament before the vote.

"It would not be justifiable and responsible not to take the risk," she added.

"I do not have a better alternative."

The German Chancellor has also made it clear that she wants to see more economic reforms in Italy as part of this measure – surprisingly, the Berlusconi government has survived a crisis and seems there is an agreement on increasing the state pension age to 67 from 65.  It has been suggested that Mr. Berlusconi got the deal after pledging to step down early next year.

The whole world, especially the financial markets are watching and it is imperative that the EU leaders come out with a substantial solution – otherwise it could repeat the Lehman effect and this time we are not talking about banks but countries with huge debt burdens.  If the EU leaders fail to come up with a solution this evening, it is lack of further investor confidence would add fuel to the fire and the contagion could spread rapidly.

No wonder David Cameron is still in Brussels even though the meeting of the EU27 has been over for a while.

Issues

EU leaders inch toward deal for Greece and euro

 Permanent budget monitoring on cards

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou (r) embraces Luxembourger Prime Minister (c) under the look of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi during a working session of the European Council at the Justus Lipsius building, EU headquarters in Brussels, on Wednesday.

European Union leaders edged late Wednesday toward a plan to bolster the euro and help Greece overcome its debt problems but it appeared that they would not finalize proposals on a range of issues, including the size of haircut for Greek bondholders.

The Greek government had been hoping that the meeting of all 27 EU leaders, followed by talks between those representing just the 17 countries in the eurozone, would culminate in an agreement on the exact size of the writedowns for holders of Greek debt, the recapitalization of European banks and the steps to strengthen the European Financial Stability Facility.

Speaking on his way into the talks, Prime Minister George Papandreou said:

Now is the time for the European leadership collectively to take decisions to end the uncertainty, end the crisis, turn the page and make sure we make a big step forward for the better future and prosperity and security for our peoples in Europe.

However, by late last night it appeared that the talks would deliver an incomplete set of proposals.

According to a draft statement obtained by Reuters before the conclusion of the meeting, the eurozone aims to leverage its 440-billion-euro bailout fund several fold but finance ministers will only agree on the details of how that will be done in November.

In relation to Greece, the document said that the European Commission was to strengthen its monitoring of the troubled country and that Greek banks would be provided with adequate support to recapitalize and cope with losses from any haircut.

Speaking in the German Parliament before the meeting, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that permanent surveillance of Greeces budget would be desirable. At the moment, Athens is monitored every three months by inspectors from the Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.

We must certainly accompany Greece for quite some time to come, said Merkel.

Reports before Wednesdays meeting ended suggested that the size of the haircut would be at least 50 percent, and that Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy would personally negotiate with banking representatives to convince the investors to accept the reduction voluntarily.

The EU leaders were expected to say in their statement that Greece is an exceptional and unique case requiring private sector involvement in a bid to nip in the bud any speculation about other eurozone countries also having their debt reduced.

A Sleepless Night and Fateful Decisions in Brussels

Published:

октомври 27, 2011 15:56, Ralitsa Kovacheva, Sofia

The summit of the euro area leaders was so loaded with expectations for fateful decisions that when these had been taken, even the leaders themselves seemed to be surprised.

Greece

When the meeting continued to the wee hours of 27 October it became clear that the reason was the negotiations with the private sector to reduce the Greek debt.

Among the journalists in Brussels a rumour spread that German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and IMF Director Christine Lagarde were involved in negotiations with the Institute of International Finance (IIF), which represented the private financial institutions in the negotiations on the Greek debt.

The talks were held in parallel to the eurozone summit in a separate room in the Council building.

Shortly before 4 am local time there was a breakthrough when it

seemed that private banks would not yield to the politicians' request to accept 50% losses of the Greek bonds value.

"We only have one offer to make and that was accepted," Angela Merkel said at the briefing after the summit.

According to an official statement by the euro leaders, there will be "a voluntary bond exchange" which must be implemented in early 2012, but details are yet to be developed.

According to a statement by IIF Director Charles Dallara, “the net present value of bondholders’ losses had not yet been determined" and negotiations should continue “to develop a concrete voluntary agreement”, the Financial Times wrote.

For their part, "the eurozone Member States would contribute to the PSI [Private Sector Involvement] package up to 30 bn euro," the statement said.

According to Angela Merkel, as a result of the operation, the Greek debt would be reduced by about 100 billion euros.

Additionally, the eurozone countries are ready to provide further assistance to Greece, worth 100 billion euros, based on a new programme that will be agreed by the end of the year.

The German chancellor explained that because of the deteriorated situation in the country the price of the new loan would be significantly higher than the 109 billion euros agreed on 21 July - 163 billion euros, if there was no deal with private creditors.

Greece, in turn, is obliged to implement additional measures, as there will be enhanced control over their implementation by the creditors.

As Ms Merkel explained, instead of having missions every three months the Troika would have permanent presence in Athens, in order to monitor the actions of the Greek authorities.

Greece has also committed to put back into the EFSF 15 billion euros raised through privatisation.

The ultimate goal is, thanks to the deal with private creditors and the additional measures taken by the Greek Government, by the end of the decade the Greek debt to be reduced from the current 150% of GDP to 120% of GDP, which is considered a more sustainable level.

The rescue fund will dispose 1 trillion euros

As expected, the leaders endorsed two models to use more efficiently the rescue fund EFSF.

The fund will offer to private investors risk insurance of new debt issued by euro area countries, thereby reducing the funding cost.

At the same time, a parallel fund will be created (as a special purpose vehicle), which will combine "resources from private and public financial institutions and investors."

Thanks to this the EFSF is expected to increase its financial capacity 4 to 5 times, approximately up to 1 trillion euros, but the amount depends on the specific conditions, as said in a statement by European Council President Herman Van Rompuy.

It is expected details of the implementation of both models to be finalised by the euro area finance ministers (the Eurogroup) in November.

Brussels is hoping that some of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), as well as large private investors will be interested in such a joint venture with the euro area.

Today, French President Nicolas Sarkozy is holding talks on the issue with Chinese President Hu Jintao.

An option for possible greater IMF participation is also being discussed but the euro leaders are concise on the topic:

"In addition, further enhancement of the EFSF resources can be achieved by cooperating even more closely with the IMF. The Eurogroup, the Commission and the EFSF will work on all possible options", the statement reads.

106 billion euros for banks

As euinside wrote , the leaders have agreed a common plan "for restoring confidence in the banking sector" which includes "facilitating access to term-funding" and creation of a temporary buffer by "requiring a significantly higher capital ratio of 9% of the highest quality capital" by the end of June 2012.

According to the European Banking Authority ( EBA ) recapitalisation of banks will cost approximately 106 billion euros.

EBA disseminated a country by country information on potential needs of the banking sector, noting that the final figures would be clear in November, as the EBA had not conducted a new round of stress tests but used the data from the stress-testing in June.

Greece needs 30 billion euros for bank recapitalisation, as the funds are provided in its second rescue programme.

French banks, which are at risk because of their large exposures to peripheral economies debt, must raise nearly 9 billion euros capital buffer, and German banks need 5 billion euros, according to the EBA.

Spain

However, Spain seems to be most problematic, as its banks need a buffer of over

26 billion euros.

This could become a severe hardship if state aid for banks is needed, given the difficult financial situation of the country and the strong market pressure in recent months.

Recent data suggest that Madrid will probably not be able to reduce its deficit to 6% of GDP, as planned.

This will significantly worsen its situation, although at this stage both the Spanish authorities and European institutions deny any possibility Spain to ask a bailout from the IMF and the EU. The statement of the euro leaders stresses that "strictly implementing budgetary adjustment as planned is key, including at regional level", and that Spain should take measures to promote growth and "to reduce the unacceptable high level of unemployment".

Italy

There is a similar situation in Italy , whose banks need additional capital of nearly 15 billion euros, while the country is trying to impose budget constraints and reduce the deficit.

Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has sent letters to the Presidents of the Commission and the Council, describing Rome's plans for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms.

The leaders' statement, however, makes it clear that there are no deadlines for their implementation, so Italy is called "to present as a matter of urgency an ambitious timetable".

Rome is committed to achieve a balanced budget by 2013 and reduce its debt to 113% of GDP in 2014.

Perhaps this decision was not a self-initiative of Rome, judging from the words

of German Chancellor Angela Merkel:

"This was particularly important that Italy has agreed to reduce its debt by 2014 to 113 percent.

This is a remarkable reduction, and I think this will be an important message."

Leaders expect by the end of the year Rome to present a clear plan how it would fulfil the stated intention to increase the retirement age to 67 years by 2026.

The Commission is invited to assess the proposed measures and to monitor their implementation.

Many of the new rules to strengthen the economic governance of the euro area have also been cleared out with yesterday's decisions.

A Sleepless Night and Fateful Decisions in Brussels

Germany:

Greek Debt to be Reduced to 120% of GDP by 2020

Published:

октомври 26, 2011 19:30, Ralitsa Kovacheva, Sofia

The German Bundestag supported, by a large majority, Chancellor Angela Merkel hours before the crucial meeting of EU leaders and the eurozone in particular.

The lawmakers gave Ms Merkel a clear mandate to negotiate with the other 16 eurozone countries to find a comprehensive solution to the debt crisis . The main elements of this comprehensive solution are the new rescue programme for Greece, private sector involvement in the Greek debt reduction and increasing the eurozone rescue fund EFSF, the official press release of the chancellery stated.

The Economic and Monetary Union is currently experiencing its biggest stress test, Angela Merkel said in her speech to the lawmakers.

"We want to Greece quickly get back on its feet," she said, as this would require "a larger share of private creditors on a second rescue package for Greece."

Athens must reduce its debt to 120% of its economy by 2020, Ms Merkel noted.

According to  Eurostat 's provisional data for 2010, the Greek debt is about 150% of GDP. To achieve such a reduction, instead of 21% losses agreed on July 21, Greece's private creditors should suffer significantly greater losses.

According to the Troika (the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF), these should be around 50%, according to the eurozone governments - about 60%, and banks offer no more than 40%. Negotiations on this issue are still ongoing and it seems unlikely to end with a concrete solution today.

As euinside already forecast , it is not expected either a detailed decision to be taken on the other issue - the increase of the rescue fund EFSF.

Angela Merkel told the lawmakers that at the summit a political decision on the matter would be taken and then appropriate guidelines would be presented for the model to increase the fund's efficiency, which would be again consulted with the Bundestag.

In any case, any involvement of the European Central Bank is excluded:

"All models in this direction are off the table," Chancellor Merkel underlined.

She said the risk of the fund's maximisation would be acceptable and German participation in it would remain unchanged - 211 billion euros.

According to the official release of the chancellery, two models are being discussed, as euinside already explained . One is the EFSF to insure partially new debt issuance of eurozone countries that are under market pressure.

The second option is to set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) through which to share risk between public and private funding, adding to the public funds of the EFSF external financing from private investors.

According to the chancellery, the two models are not mutually exclusive from each other.

A possible combination between the two options was mentioned also by European Council President Herman Van Rompuy after the meeting of eurozone leaders on 23 October .

Germany:

Greek Debt to be Reduced to 120% of GDP by 2020

bondholder haircuts European Financial Stability Facility Greece bailout

EU leaders and bank officials struck a last-minute agreement early today (27 October) to write off 50% of Greek debt from their books, in a back-room deal that will see weaker banks receive aid from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).

The deal, which has been months in the making, came unexpectedly at 4 a.m. after marathon talks between the Institute of International Finance (IIF) and EU officials tucked away in a separate room from the leaders' summit in Brussels.

Heads of state eagerly awaited word from the EU official Vittorio Grilli who was talking to the representative from the IIF Charles Dallara.

At 5 a.m., negotiations appeared to have broken down between the two sides and expectations on a deal were very low.

At the last minute, banks seemingly caved in to German demands for a 50% cut on their holdings of Greek sovereign debt to allow leaders to move forward on a second bailout for the beleaguered country.

Leading European banks ING and BNP Paribas had said previously they would accept no more than a 40% cut.

“Just days ago a deal was less than expected,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced at 4 a.m. press briefing.

“We only have one offer to make and that was accepted,” Merkel said.

The 50% cut is intended to help Greece arrive at a 120% debt to GDP ratio by 2020, according to a summit statement following the eurozone leaders’ agreement.

"We invite Greece, private investors and all parties concerned to develop a voluntary bond exchange with a nominal discount of 50% on notional Greek debt held by private investors," the statement said.

But banks did not capitulate too easily.

The paper also confirms that they will be receiving a €30-billion sweetener in exchange for the deal which will partly come from the EFSF and partly from money made by the Greek government on attempts to privatise state assets.

In addition, leaders agreed to an extra €100 billion in funding to help Greece surmount its debts.

“The official sector stands ready to provide additional programme financing of up to €100 billion until 2014, including the required recapitalisation of Greek banks,” the statement says.

Greek banks are estimated to have the biggest capital holes on their balance sheets.

Figures from Morgan Stanley estimate that Greek banks would require more than €80 billion in handouts, while Spain, Italy, France and Germany require up to €30 billion between them.

Positions: 

The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, said early Thursday that the kind of drama similar to that which followed the collapse of  Lehman Brothers  in 2008 had been averted and that markets would be reassured when they reopen.

Sony Kapoor, the founder of the Re-Define think tank said:

“[We] had argued very strongly for an outright haircut.

However, it may have come too late to really restore Greek debt sustainability.”

“Both the size and the shape of the Private Sector Involvement deal is much better than what was agreed in July, provided there is a deal,” Kapoor said.

Stocks surge after deal reached 27/10/2011 10:13 CET

Europe’s leaders may have stopped the rot for now but the financial crisis is far from over and the region’s banks are still staring into a deep black hole.

They have been told to keep higher reserves of cash which means there will not be as much available to lend to businesses.

The worry is that the bank recapitalisation plans risk a credit crunch.

Another problem for the region is that with flagging domestic demand for goods all countries in the bloc have been trying to boost their economies with export, but now orders are slipping.

A lot of the debt which sparked this crisis exists because peripheral euro zone economies are uncompetitive, both within the region and in comparison with emerging markets.

Consumer and corporate confidence is unlikely to be restored until there is a strategy for breaking the current vicious cycle of budget cuts, which are sapping economic growth and forcing ever deeper austerity.

To get more perspective on this euronews spoke to Trevor Williams, Chief Economist at Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets in London.

Stefan Grobe, euronews:

“Trevor, the summit was the 14th in the almost two years since Europe pledged solidarity with Greece.

Does the result live up to markets’ expectations?”

Williams:

“I think from the results you’re seeing in the initial markets reaction — with the equity markets up and the euro up — that one could easily argue that yes, given the expectations that there were, then the market reaction would suggest that they are happy with what they’ve heard so far.

“There’s a challenge — that challenge is whether or not those bits which have been left for November and December and later, live up to those expectations as well.”

euronews:

“The banks were bullied into accepting 50 percent writedowns on Greek debt by the threat of a scenario of total insolvency of Greece.

This is what is called “voluntary losses”.

Banks are also being asked to shore up their capital and to build higher reserves.

Is there any good news for the banks?”

Williams:

“Well I think it is very difficult to find any, but if there was any, it was in a statement which accompanied the overall release which said something like that this was temporary, that the extra capital buffers required would be seen as exceptional and once the circumstances which led to those capital buffers being required were removed or lessened, then those capital buffers might be reduced, that was the implication of that statement.

“And to that extent there was something in there for the banks, but overall I think it is very difficult to find anything which was positive news from a banking perspective in Europe as a whole.”

euronews:

“Europe’s economic position can only recover and the sovereign debt crisis can eventually only be solved through economic growth.

Did the European Union create the conditions for that, given the tough new restrictions on banks?”

Williams:

“I think the short answer has got to be no, the issue that was dealt with by the EU leaders’ summit was around how to reduce the potential contagion from any Greek default and that this was aimed primarily at making sure that banks had enough capital available.

It hasn’t changed the economic equation, it hasn’t addressed the more fundamental issues around competitiveness of the EU countries and it certainly hasn’t done anything about the current trends in European growth — which are towards some weakness in the back end of this year and possibly the first part of next year and I think a potential for a quarter of contraction.”

euronews:

“The oil giant Shell announced that it is planning to curb its investments in the EU because of doubts about the region’s chances of recovery.

Is that an isolated opinion or will it become common corporate policy?”

Williams:

“I think that clearly some companies are looking more at the European growth profile compared with that of other parts of the world, including the US and emerging markets, and further afield.

On the surface I have to say there is a lot of pessimism about the competitiveness of Europe as a whole and whether or not the issues which keep growth weak have been really addressed.

And those issues are pretty clear to everyone — it’s about regulation, it’s about the state of the banking sector, it’s about whether or not the EU is serious about reducing the tax burden on companies, and helping to encourage growth from those kinds of policies — and this communique clearly did nothing about that.”

The eurozone rescue package is progress but is not yet a decisive response to the crisis.

The deal reached by eurozone leaders in the early hours of Thursday morning represents a major step forward in managing the eurozone crisis.

But many details on parts of the package need to be clarified before the effectiveness of the deal can be properly assessed.

The main elements of the deal reached on Thursday are:

a plan to recapitalise EU banks by June next year;

options for leveraging the eurozone's €440 billion rescue fund;

and a plan to cut Greece 's debt by around 50% by 2020.

The bank recapitalisation plan requires EU banks to increase by June 2012 the ratio of holdings of highest-quality capital, known as ‘core tier one', to 9% of their assets.

At the same time, banks will receive guarantees for their liabilities so that they can continue to obtain medium-term funding and maintain credit flows to households and businesses.

This will be co-ordinated at an EU level, to prevent distortions of competition that could be caused by purely national schemes.

European Banking Authority

Plans to achieve the capital increase will be co-ordinated by the European Banking Authority (EBA).

Banks are expected to try to raise additional capital from the private sector first.

If this is not possible, governments can provide the necessary funds.

If they are unable to do so, the eurozone rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), can lend to banks.

The key issue is the definition of “highest-quality capital” that the EBA uses in calculating the 9%. The decision on which types of capital can be counted against the target will have a major impact on whether banks meet the 9% goal and how much additional capital they have to raise.

Sony Kapoor of Re-Define, a Brussels-based think-tank, said:

“By far the biggest capital needs are in weak countries, which are exactly the countries that will have the toughest time mobilising money.” Spanish banks, for example, are expected to need around €26 billion of the total €106bn capital available for injection into all major EU banks.

Eurozone leaders have claimed that options for leveraging the EFSF to increase the resources it can lend could multiply its effective capacity by a factor of four or five.

Nicolas Sarkozy , France's president, said this leveraging could increase the EFSF's capacity to €1 trillion.

The two options are providing insurance on the issuance of eurozone bonds so investors would be protected against a proportion of potential losses in the case of a sovereign default.

The precise figure has not been specified, but a figure of 20% has been mentioned.

The other option is to create special investment vehicles (SPVs), controlled by the EFSF.

These would use capital from other sources, such as sovereign wealth funds.

Sarkozy is planning to talk to the Chinese authorities about a possible contribution to an SPV.

‘Not a fully loaded bazooka'

Carsten Brzeski , a senior economist at ING , a bank, commented on the lack of a precise figure in the conclusions of the eurozone summit, saying:

“As long as no further details are known, this is only a commitment, not a fully loaded bazooka.”

Getting agreement with banks to accept a write-down on the value of their holdings of Greek government debt was one of the most difficult parts of the package.

The eurozone summit was suspended before midnight to allow eurozone leaders, including Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , to negotiate directly with representatives of international banks on the size of the haircut.

They reached a compromise in which Greece, private investors and governments are invited to work on agreeing a “voluntary bond exchange” with a cut of 50% in the value of the debt.

Kapoor said:

“An invitation to agree to a haircut is not the same as a haircut.”

Brzeski added that it was uncertain that plans to reduce Greece's debt burden by €100bn would succeed because funds from a new support programme from Greece would be needed to recapitalise Greek banks, reducing the overall impact.

Brzeski described the overall package as a “step in the right direction” but not the final word on the crisis.

Negotiations on the definition of highest-quality capital and on getting banks to agree to the 50% haircut will continue in the coming weeks.

Initial market reactions to the deal have been positive.

But the package's chances of success in restoring stability to the eurozone will depend on those negotiations achieving the ambitious results claimed by eurozone leaders in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Otherwise, leaders will be forced to return to Brussels once again.

Deals on Greek debt cut and bail-out fund still elusive.

The EU 's national leaders have started a summit meeting in Brussels at which they hope to agree measures to stem the eurozone crisis.

Leaders from the 27 EU member states began a meeting at 6pm, and this is scheduled to be followed an hour later by a meeting of the 17 countries that use the euro.

The meetings are intended to agree ways to end the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.

Leaders are supposed to agree to cut Greece 's debt to manageable levels, to boost the firepower of the eurozone's rescue fund, and to increase the capital reserves of European banks.

But a deal on all three elements is still some way off and officials are predicting that the meetings could last until late in the night.

One of the major obstacles to a deal is getting agreement on the size of the reduction in Greece's debt.

Angela Merkel , Germany's chancellor, told German MPs earlier today that she wanted to cut Greece's debt to 120% of the country's gross domestic product by 2020.

This would mean a 50% reduction - or ‘haircut' - in the value of banks' and other financial institutions' holdings of Greek debt.

But banks, which are currently negotiating with eurozone officials at a separate meeting in Brussels, are resisting a cut larger than 40%.

Leaders also need consensus on how to increase the effectiveness of the eurozone's bail-out fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).

Merkel told German MPs today that two options were under consideration by leaders:

using the EFSF to provide insurance against default on new bonds issued by eurozone countries;

and creating a special investment vehicle which could lend to eurozone countries. 

Leaders also want Silvio Berlusconi , Italy's prime minister, to present a credible plan for reducing Italy's debt levels at the meeting.

Hopes of a deal tonight were given a boost by Merkel winning a large majority in the Bundestag today for extending the firepower of the EFSF.

EU to boost rescue fund fivefold by aping bank leverage

 By Sarah Collins | Thursday 27 October 2011

Eurozone leaders are to leverage their financial stability facility rescue fund by up to five times using techniques they admit have been used by banks “for centuries”.

In an early morning deal on 27 October they agreed to boost the fund - which will have around EUR240 billion left after it funds bailouts for Ireland, Portugal and Greece - to up to EUR1 trillion in an effort to quell market doubts that eurozone countries can cope with their debts and shoulder losses resulting from a Greek debt writedown.

The move is part of a three-pronged strategy to defeat the eurozone debt crisis, which has seen bond and equity markets tumble since an initial deal in July failed to convince investors that the region can deal with spillover effects in Italy and Spain.

The other two parts of the plan - a EUR106 billion bank recapitalisation and EUR100 billion bailout for Greece, including significant debt writedowns - were also agreed after marathon negotiations that lasted for more than 10 hours.

“This is a systemic concern threatening the stability of the eurozone as a whole,” said European Council president Herman Van Rompuy.

“This threat has to be contained.”

Leverage

The fund will be leveraged via one of two options:

using the fund as a first-loss insurer to guarantee part of the bond sales of weaker states, or by creating a series of special purpose vehicles, using EFSF cash to attract other - private or public - investors.

China and the International Monetary Fund have already expressed an interest in contributing to the fund.

French president Nicolas Sarkozy is speak with Chinese premier Hu Jintao later on 27 October, he said, to prepare the G20 meeting on 3 and 4 November in Cannes, while the EFSF’s head, Klaus Regling, is to travel to China on 28 October.

The two options can be used “simultaneously”, EU leaders said, and the amount they can leverage will depend on “their specific features and market conditions”, meaning it will depend on what investors require.

“This has been the core business of banks for centuries,” Van Rompuy said.

“We are doing this within limits, in a reasonable fashion,” he said.

ECB

The European Central Bank will not be involved in the new-style EFSF, which will still provide cash directly to states to fund full bailout programmes, but will also, under changes agreed in July, be able to buy sovereign bonds in primary and secondary markets, ringfence money for bank recapitalisations and offer pre-emptive loans to countries that are temporarily strapped for cash.

However, incoming ECB head Mario Draghi has indicated that the bank will continue its contentious bond buying programme, which had as of 26 October left it on the hook for EUR170 billion worth of Greek, Irish, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian debt.

IMF leveraging?

However, the International Monetary Fund may be asked “cooperate more closely” with the EFSF under a third leveraging option which eurozone leaders said would be thrashed out by eurozone finance ministers, the European Commission and the EFSF itself.

Technical work on the other two options will be wound up in November at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers.

“The decision to leverage the capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), including through the use of new Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), can strengthen Europe's defenses against contagion and help ensure the proper functioning of the sovereign debt market,” said IMF managing director Christine Lagarde.

Governance

A fourth part of the deal intended to save the eurozone is a massive overhaul of economic governance, beyond what was agreed under a “six pack” of measures last month.

This will include new powers for a budget commissioner and further intrusion into national budget-making, with the Commission due to make proposals under article 136 of the Lisbon treaty, which fosters closer eurozone integration.

“Being part of a monetary union has far reaching implications and implies a much closer coordination and surveillance to ensure stability and sustainability of the whole area,” leaders said in a statement.

Newspapers in Greece reacted with measured relief on Thursday after EU leaders sealed a deal to write down debts (AFP)

Asian markets rallied yesterday after EU leaders stayed up late in Brussels on Wednesday to coerce banks into taking a “voluntary” 50% haircut on Greek government debt.

That has reduced the likelihood of Greece incurring a default on its debt, for now, but many details still need to be agreed between politicians, bankers and regulators.

This is a crisis that isn’t going away.

That, at least, was the general view coming from research desks yesterday.

In addition to the writedown on Greek debt, aimed at bringing the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio down to 120%, the deal includes a €130 billion injection into the Greek economy by the EU and IMF, €106 billion in additional eurozone bank capital and a commitment to support senior unsecured term funding markets, and a plan to raise the leverage of European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) by four to five times.

China, which is a significant holder of European debt, gave its backing to the deal yesterday, saying that it is willing to “make joint efforts” to promote global economic growth, including cooperation with the EU over investment, trade and finance, according to a foreign ministry press briefing.

State news agency Xinhua was also supportive, but saved room for its customary criticism.

“This summit shows that the countries of the EU, especially its main economies, have the resolve to overcome difficulties and create an effective 'rescue umbrella' for the euro,” it said yesterday, before adding:

“At the same time, it shows the systemic and structural problems the EU has when it comes to dealing with the crisis that demand improvement.”

For once, Xinhua was mild compared to what strategists and traders were saying.

“The current eurozone talks will not solve this crisis and it will get worse — much worse,” said Albert Edwards, a famously gloomy strategist at Societe Generale, in a note sent out yesterday.

“The increasingly frenzied attempts of eurozone governments to persuade financial markets that they can draw a line under this crisis will ultimately fail — even if this week’s measures bring some short-term relief.

I have minimal confidence that governments can turn this around within the confines of the eurozone project.”

It is no longer just the perma-bears who are talking in such bleak terms.

Paul Robinson, head of global FX research at Barclays Capital, was recommending buying the euro in the wake of the last last-ditch Greek accord in July.

But he is not so confident this time.

“Even if confidence increases as a result of the agreements already announced, and the information that we will presumably get over the next few weeks, euro area growth looks likely to be extremely weak,” he wrote in a note to clients yesterday.

“The weaker it is, the harder it will be to sort the problems out, and the looser ECB [European Central Bank] policy is likely to be.”

He recommends getting out of euros and into just about anything else;

US dollars for the cautious, Asian currencies as a more bullish trade.

Forex markets did just that yesterday, helping riskier Asian currencies to outperform the euro despite the supposedly good news emanating from Brussels — the Bloomberg-J.P. Morgan Asia Dollar Index, which comprises Asia ex-Japan’s 10 most-liquid currencies, rose 0.5% to a six-week high.

Meanwhile, the strength in other assets was described as a relief rally, driven by investors who had been preparing for a worse outcome.

Asian investment-grade credits tightened by 15bp to 184bp, according to Nomura, while stock markets across the region enjoyed steady gains throughout the day. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closed up 3.3%, while Singapore’s Straits Times index finished 2.8% higher.

Relief will give way to realism in the end, according to Edwards at SocGen, as the crisis in Europe worsens.

“The ECB will have to choose between its two most cherished ideals:

the euro or its hard money principles,” he said.

“Notwithstanding some legal issues to get around and Germany being outvoted, we think the impending threat of a euro break-up will force the ECB to begin printing money, very reluctantly joining in the global QE party.”

That is not a solution, said Edwards, but it is a necessary evil at this point if the euro is to survive.

“The question for me is not if the ECB will print, but rather will Germany leave the eurozone after being over-ruled on the ECB (again!) and in the face of such monetary debauchery?”

Brussels:

Euro zone leaders said on Thursday they had reached agreement on a comprehensive package of measures to tackle the euro zone’s sovereign debt crisis.

The leaders said private holders of Greek debt would accept a 50 percent writedown on their holdings as part of a scheme to reduce the country’s debt burden.

And the euro zone heads of state and government also agreed on the need to recapitalise European banks and to increase the firepower of the euro zone bailout fund, the EFSF, to about €1 trillion.

“The summit allowed us to adopt the components of a global response, of an ambitious response, of a credible response to the crisis that is sweeping across the euro zone” French President Nicholas Sarkozy explained.

The firepower of EFSF has been increased to €1 trillion.

AFP

“If the current president or the upcoming president are saying that they will intervene until the new mechanism is really put into place, it is up to them to decide.

So we are not interfereing in this, we are not asking for it. We take note of the declarations made recently by Mr Draghi but we have no demands and nothing to request” European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said about the role of the European Central Bank and upcoming ECB President Mario Draghi.

“We want to put Greece on track, where in 2020 it will have reduced its public debt to 120 percent of GDP. Since July, market conditions have worsened.

The new plan includes additional effort by the state sector.

“It also includes a voluntary contribution by private creditors who have lent to Greece.

It was agreed by them tonight and amounts to nominal discount of 50 percent of notional Greek debt” Draghi added.

About the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), he said “A sufficient firewall against contagion, thanks to an agreement to multiply to up five-fold the firepower of the EFSF.

The leverage could be up to €one trillion under certain assumptions about market conditions and investors’ responsiveness in view of economic policies.

“We have identified two approaches for the EFSF.

The first one aims at getting credit enhancement to sovereign bonds issued by member states.

Under the second approach, the fund could set up one or several (special purpose vehicles) SPVs to finance its operations.

Each option could lead to leverage of up to four to five times.

They can be used simultaneously so as to increase the robustness of the financial strategy.”

“We are all aware the situation is serious.

The situation was evolving into a systemic concern.

This threat has to be contained.”

“There are several measures and commitments.

And there is afterwards a task given to the European Commission and to the Italian authorities to provide all of the necessary data for the implementation” said European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso about the situation in Italy.

“So the key is implementation.

This is the key. It is not enough to make commitments, it is necessaary now to check if they are really implementing.”

“I had the impression all partners understand that we need enhanced integration, not only at the level of the Eurogroup but at the level of the whole European Union” said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on EU integration.

Describing the bank captial quality, Tusk added, “The key issue was the issue of high quality capital, the 9 percent ratio that was adopted that we need to maintain this ratio.

And we also adopted certain elements of the way we should proceed to attain this goal.

An emotional element during this debate, was the fact of making this exceptional circumstance and not permanent element, so this will not be a permanent solution for the future.”

“The banking element is part of a broader package.

All participants were fully aware that the draft annex to this statement concerning the recapitalisation of banks will work only when the euro area approves other elements that are currently being debated.

“Bank recapitalisation without the remaining elements, such as the so-called firewall wouldn’t have any chance of success.

So the statement today is a pre-condition and it’s really an introduction for looking for further elements in the euro area with greater comfort” said Tusk.

“Bank recapitalisation is an issue concerning all member states.

This project cannot be seen in isolation and independently of the other elements.

My impression is that all 27 accept the idea of bank recapitalisation in this statement.

“If you are asking whether we are expecting that all decisions will be taken today during the euro area meeting I would be very cautious to make such a statement.

“I think we are very close to a full political agreement, however there are some important details that might perhaps require more time.

“It is important, however, that tonight the euro area should demonstrate that a political agreement has been achieved and the only things that remain are important, but only technical issues.”

British Prime Minister David Cameron was satisfied with the progress at the summit.

“We made good progress tonight.

It is very much in Britain’s interest that we sort out these problems and solve this crisis.

“We made good progress on the bank recapitalisation.

That wasn’t watered down, it has now been agreed.

It will only go ahead when the other parts of a full package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight” Cameron informed.

By Madeline Chambers

Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed to German lawmakers from all parties on Tuesday to back plans to boost the firepower of the euro zone rescue fund in a vote set to take place hours before Wednesday's crunch EU summit.

Merkel needs to win the parliamentary vote to have a mandate to negotiate a deal with other EU leaders aimed at delivering a range of measures to stop the euro zone debt crisis spiraling.

The bill is set to go through parliament as the government has agreed a joint motion on the plans with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens but Merkel still faces a rebellion from within her own center-right coalition.

A test run held on Tuesday showed she is likely to win the vote without having to rely on opposition parties' support -- but only just.

In the ballot, a total of 16 lawmakers from Merkel's coalition parties either voted against or abstained.

The proposals, to increase the efficiency of the 440 billion euro ($610 billion) fund without pouring more taxpayers' money into it, are the subject of fierce debate in Europe's largest economy and biggest contributor to the fund.

"The international negotiating position must be to get the best for Germany and for Europe," Merkel told reporters.

"I am bound by my oath of office to avert damage for the German people, to do good for the German people.

That must be the guiding principle in my negotiations," she said, adding she was pushing for as much support as possible in the vote.

Merkel is battling sliding ratings for herself and her center-right coalition over her handling of the euro zone crisis and most Germans oppose granting more aid to Greece.

Critics at home and abroad have accused her of taking a dithering approach that has exacerbated the debt crisis.

Peter Altmaier, parliamentary floor leader of Merkel's conservative bloc, urged all parties to back the plans.

"Europe expects us to be the standard bearer on this matter and the Bundestag to take a clear position that stretches across the parties," he told reporters.

SLOW DEMOCRACY

On Monday, her conservatives unexpectedly announced the Bundestag lower house would hold a full vote on the new guidelines on the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).

Merkel's hands have been tied in her negotiations on the euro zone crisis since a Constitutional Court ruling last month demanded a greater say for German lawmakers on bailout issues.

That ruling has frustrated some EU leaders eager to implement quick solutions.

Even after the summit, Germany's parliamentary budget committee must meet to discuss the outcome.

"The Chancellor wants to have as big a majority as possible.

In putting her proposals to parliament as a whole, she is using the Bundestag as a proxy for the general public," said politics professor Juergen Falter of Mainz University.

"It is very unlikely that this won't pass," he added.

Just a month ago, Merkel struggled to contain a rebellion from within her own center-right coalition in a parliamentary vote on the EFSF.

She was only five votes short of having to rely on opposition support which would have been a major blow, possibly even triggering early elections.

Falter said she could not be certain of getting the plans through with a "Chancellor's majority" from her own coalition, rather than relying on the opposition this time round.

"If she didn't get it (the chancellor's majority), it would be a blow in the medium term," said Falter.

The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens have complained about the lack of time to look at the guidelines but have long argued for stronger tools to tackle the crisis.

"There is a basic agreement between the (ruling) coalition and the opposition," said SPD budget expert Carsten Schneider, adding that parliamentary parties still had to vote on the draft motion.

REBELS AT THE READY

Merkel's Free Democrat (FDP) coalition partners said they would back the plans.

However, rebels are gearing up to defy Merkel.

"I will again vote "no" as all these measures are not helping to solve the problem in the long run," Wolfgang Bosbach, a prominent CDU rebel who complained of being browbeaten in the run-up to last month's vote.

The EU paper, obtained by Reuters, shows two options for increasing the fund's firepower -- an insurance model and a special purpose investment vehicle (SPIV).

Investors hope leaders will on Wednesday decide which of the two approaches should be used, or a combination.

Bosbach will be joined by FDP waverers who fear the crisis is spiraling out of control.

"I worry that Italy will be attached to the drip.

If that happens, the crisis will take on new proportions.

No leveraged rescue mechanism in the world will be enough," FDP lawmaker Frank Schaeffler told Handelsblatt.

The conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), which has taken a tougher line on Greece than its sister CDU party and is more skeptical toward Europe, played down the importance of the plans getting through without relying on the opposition.

"We need a majority in the Bundestag, it is certain that we will get that."

said Gerda Hasselfeldt, leader of the CSU parliamentary party in Berlin.

Asked what it would mean if support fell short of the "chancellor's majority," she said:

"That means nothing for the EU summit, and certainly no weakening of the chancellor."

Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Europe not to be complacent about its peace and prosperity on Wednesday, as German lawmakers approved plans to boost the firepower of the euro zone rescue fund ahead of an emergency EU summit.

Addressing a packed parliament before the vote, Merkel urged the lower house Bundestag to fulfill its "historic duty" and said Europe was in its toughest phase since the end of World War Two.

"No one should take for it for granted that there will be peace and affluence in Europe in the next half century," said Merkel, a pastor's daughter brought up in Communist eastern Germany.

"The world is watching Germany and Europe to see if we are ready and able to take responsibility.

If the euro fails, Europe fails," said Merkel, in a characteristically sober tone.

The vote binds Merkel to sticking closely to the text of the motion passed by the Bundestag, boosting her bargaining power at the Brussels summit on issues such as the European Central Bank's involvement in tackling the crisis.

The prospects of a comprehensive deal looked dim, however, with disagreements remaining in several crucial areas.

The Bundestag's vice president said of the 596 lawmakers who voted, 503 backed the motion, 89 opposed it and there were four abstentions.

"With its clear, cross-party majority, the German parliament has strengthened the hand of the German government in its negotiations on fighting the euro debt crisis," said Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle after the vote.

"With this, the government can fight forcefully for our interests," added Westerwelle, a member of the Free Democrats (FDP), Merkel's junior coalition partner.

In a minor boost to her waning authority at home, she won the vote without having to rely on opposition support.

However, 15 rebels from her own center-right coalition either voted against the motion or abstained, highlighting the struggle Merkel faces in convincing Germans of the need for Europe's biggest economy to help its indebted partners.

Merkel is battling sliding ratings for herself and her coalition over her handling of the euro zone crisis.

Critics at home and abroad have accused her of dithering, thereby exacerbating the debt crisis, and frustration is rife.

DIM PROSPECTS

The proposals to increase the effectiveness of the 440 billion euro ($610 billion) European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) without pouring more taxpayers' money into it, have been the subject of fierce debate in Germany, the biggest contributor to the rescue fund, and the rest of the euro zone.

Disagreements remain, including over how to scale up the EFSF.

One option is to use it to offer guarantees to purchasers of new euro zone debt, the other to use part of its capacity to set up a special purpose investment vehicle to attract money from sovereign wealth funds and other investors.

A combination may also be possible.

Merkel said it was justifiable to take the chance of higher risks stemming from leveraging the EFSF and that failure to give the fund more firepower would be irresponsible.

"The goal of the meeting tonight must be to get a result under which Greece will by 2020 have a debt to gross domestic product ratio of 120 percent," said Merkel.

Under the sustainability scenarios put forward by Greece's 'troika' of lenders -- the European Commission , European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- that would mean a 50 percent writedown for private sector bondholders.

The role of the European Central Bank in resolving the crisis is also subject to dispute, France wanting a deeper and more direct ECB involvement, something Germany strongly opposes.

The motion passed by German lawmakers states that the EFSF cannot be financed through the ECB and with a leveraged EFSF, the central bank will no longer need to buy bonds on the secondary market.

German lawmakers said this was not necessarily a rebuff to them as the phrase in their motion expresses an expectation and stops short of saying the ECB cannot buy bonds if necessary.

Merkel's hands have been tied by a Constitutional Court ruling last month, which demanded a greater say for German lawmakers.

That has frustrated some EU leaders eager to implement quick solutions.

Lawmakers -- either in the lower house's full session or its 41-member budget committee -- will have to be consulted again about the EU leaders' summit conclusions.

Europe has put out a brush fire in forging a deal to pare down Greece’s debt and hopefully ward off contagion. 

But the forest is still at risk.

Europe’s economy remains fragile despite an agreement reached Thursday that would slash 50% of Greece’s debt held by private investors, a pact designed to solidify Europe’s banking system and prevent the continent’s debt woes from spreading.

The announcement sent U.S. stock markets soaring on optimism that a problem many feared could push the global economy back into recession may be moving toward a resolution.

“For the first time I think (European leaders) did something constructive,” said Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a public policy and economics research organization in Arlington, Va.

Waldman said up to now, European policy makers had treated Greece’s fiscal woes as a liquidity problem and their solution was to funnel cash to the beleaguered country, in effect throwing good money after bad. The deal announced Thursday is different in that it acknowledges that Greece is essentially insolvent and cannot pay its debts.

“But this is just a first step,” Waldman cautioned, and Europe’s tenuous economic position still poses a threat to the fragile U.S. economy, he said.

While the long-sought agreement “diminishes the odds” of a double-dip U.S. recession, “it  doesn’t take it off the table,” according to Waldman.

That’s because an agreement that eases Greece’s debt only addresses the fear of contagion and does little to spur real growth within Europe’s sluggish economy.

Naturally, a sluggish European economy dampens demand for U.S. exports there, although the U.S. makes far more products for developing countries in Asian and Latin America than it does for Europe’s advanced markets.

The indirect problem for the U.S. economy is that Europe is a major trade partner with China . If Europe’s slowdown causes a drag on the Chinese economy, that hurts the U.S. because of the close ties between the U.S. and Chinese economies.

So far the fear of contagion stemming from the European debt crisis has been more of a bogeyman than an actual impediment to U.S. economic growth.

In other words, more imagined than real.

Many analysts have noted that U.S. economic data have been slowly improving in recent weeks, even as Greece’s debt problems seemed poised to push Europe off the precipice.

And U.S. stock markets have bounced back considerably since the bear-market territory they entered over the summer, pushed there in large part by “the fear” of contagion.

Thursday’s stock surge, based largely on the Greek deal, pushed the Dow Jones Industrial average above 12,000 for the first time since August 2.

Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, speaking before the Greek debt deal was announced, predicted a “new bull-run based on improved U.S. economic conditions and Europe coming up with a plan to help stem the risk of contagion.”

While consumer sentiment remains in the dumps, recent reports have shown slight improvements in the areas of durable goods, jobless claims, retail sales and even housing starts.

“I think people had really started to become much less worried about the U.S. economy on its own,” said Michelle Girard, senior economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.

“The data in the last couple of months had been stronger and not suggested recession.

There’s been a nagging concern that the European situation could spill over to the U.S. primarily through a meltdown to the financial markets.”

“The numbers haven’t been necessarily strong but they’re better,” added John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.

Reduced fear of European debt contagion will undoubtedly spur more risk taking by investors, Ryding predicted, a forecast borne out by Thursday’s rally.

“What will change is peoples’ attitudes toward taking risk,” he said.

“People are generally bothered by the uncertainty (surrounding Europe’s debt woes), and that was especially true in early August.”

Ryding said U.S. companies are “generally undervalued” right now, and would remain so until people are more willing to take on risk.

“But once you know that they’ve done enough to contain the problem in Europe, then investors will come back,” he said.

Text European Union agreement

Mr Sarkozy said he would speak to Hu Jintao, China’s president, on Thursday about the role Beijing might play in supporting the fund.

Although the details of the deal as outlined by both European leaders and the Institute of International Finance remained vague, officials said that €30bn of the €130bn in the government bail-out money would go to so-called “sweeteners” for a future bond-swap, which would be completed by January.

Some €35bn in such “credit enhancements” were included in the original July deal with the IIF, an association of global financial institutions.

In that deal, the money was used to back new triple-A bonds that would be traded in for debtholders’ current bonds.

Whether the new programme would be organised in a similar fashion remained unclear.

Such factors as the interest rates and maturities for new bonds are critical to determining how valuable the swap will be for private investors.

Charles Dallara, the IIF managing director who served as the bondholders’ chief negotiator in Brussels, said in a statement that the net present value of bondholders’ losses had not yet been determined.

He added that his consortium would need to continue to work with authorities “to develop a concrete voluntary agreement”.

“The specific terms and conditions of the voluntary [haircuts] will be agreed by all relevant parties in the coming period and implemented with immediacy and force,” Mr Dallara said.

Some elements of the package appeared to be based on optimistic assumptions.

Under the terms of the deal, Greece agreed to put €15bn it aims to raise from a vast privatisation programme back into the European Financial Stability Facility, the eurozone’s €440bn rescue fund.

International monitors have already acknowledged that Greece will struggle to raise the €50bn in privatisation cash it promised earlier this year, but the €15bn is supposed to come on top of previous commitments.

Asked whether adding €15bn to Greece’s already faltering €50bn privatisation programme was feasible, Yves Leterme, the Belgian prime minister, distanced himself from the proposal, saying:

“This element was not a necessity for Belgium.”

“We all know there is a flaw in the implementation of Greece’s privatisation programme,” he added, stressing the need for more EU experts to help Greece meet its divestment targets.

The €15bn should be available “in the next four or five years,” he said.

Still, despite the uncertainties that remained, European leaders hailed the package as a milestone in their efforts to tackle the crisis.

“I believe this is a global, ambitious and credible response to the crisis,” Mr Sarkozy said.

Pierre Gave, head of research at Gavekal, a Hong Kong-based research group, said the Greek deal was “big on words but short on detail”.

“To me it seems like we don’t really have a lot of detail.

What is this, the 14th meeting in the last 20 months?

I think it’s just more of the same.

Europe is going to continue to muddle through but we won’t know the end-game until a year or two from now, whether we will move towards a full-scale fiscal federation or whether we will move to a breakdown of the euro experiment.”

After nervous trading in the build up to EU deal, positive trading for the euro

Publication date:

27 October 2011

Author: Richard Driver, CaxtonFX

After some very nervous trading in the build up to the announcement of a deal struck by EU leaders at yesterday’s Summit, the euro is trading very positively.

A 50% haircut on Greek debt was agreed and the bailout fund is going to be expanded from €440bn to €1trn, which represents significant progress.

There are still complaints that the package is a little light on detail but in fact the market probably got more than it was asking for in terms of progress on the three main issues of bank recapitalisation, the expanded bailout fund, and the Greek haircut issue.

STERLING/EURO:

This pair has dipped by almost a cent from yesterday’s early highs as EU leaders break some ground.

European banks have agreed to accept a 50% write-down on their Greek bonds.

The haircut is seen to be voluntary, but it remains unclear whether or not credit default swaps will trigger a ‘credit event’.

A second Greek bailout package will be agreed by the end of the year, it is promised, and Greece will receive €130bn of aid in the new year.

European banks will be recapitalised by around €106bn to firm up the sector, and the bailout fund was expanded by around four to five times.

It remains unknown how exactly this is to be done and as ever with these arrangements, “the devil is in the detail.” However, with rumours of delayed decisions and a lack of progress proved wrong, sterling looks unlikely to bounce back today.

STERLING/US DOLLAR:

After some intensely risk averse trading, the dollar is selling-off once again and this pair has recouped its losses.

The delivery of some major decisions yesterday reduced demand for safe-haven currencies, particularly as disappointment was looking more and more likely as the day progressed.

Stocks are rallying as a result and the dollar looks likely to weaken further today.

The advance quarterly US GDP figure is released at lunchtime today and is expected to pick up significantly from Q2. Again, this should be positive for market confidence and risk appetite away from the dollar.

Sterling is trading back up at $1.60 this morning but is failing to kick on for now. Regardless, the dollar looks hard-pushed to recoup much ground amid the recent positive news from the eurozone.

EURO/US DOLLAR:

The euro is trading at a seven-week high on the EU’s package, though it does fall short of “comprehensive.”

Various holes remain in the package, and yet more are bound to emerge, but the euro’s subsequent rally goes to show that the market is just pleased to see some genuine progress.

A holistic and long-term solution was not expected.

In addition to the three main issues, Italy was encouraged to raise its retirement age by the end of the year and implement promises on budget and structural reform.

This pair is trading at $1.40 this morning and consolidation may be the theme of the day. This afternoon’s US growth figure will be important and there remains scope for a pullback in risk appetite, but the euro is looking good for now.

STERLING/AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR:

Risky assets are rallying in response to the eurozone deal and this pair is trading at a seven week low.

The aussie dollar has shaken off negativity related to Wednesday morning’s weak Australian inflation data and the dovish outlook for the Australian monetary policy.

Riskier currencies such as the aussie dollar have traded primarily off headlines in the eurozone for weeks now, and there is little surprise that yesterday’s progress has helped the aussie dollar to rally.

Sterling is trading at 1.5150 now and further losses are looking very likely indeed.

Again, this afternoon’s US growth figure could be crucial.

STERLING/NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR:

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand hold rates at 2.50% as expected, but eurozone progress helped the kiwi dollar to strengthen.

Governor Bollard announced an interest rate hold last night, in line with consensus.

The RBNZ has been shaping up for a rate hike, but eurozone concerns and easing inflation have caused bets to be pared back of late.

However, yesterday’s RBNZ statement was surprisingly hawkish, asserting a bias towards monetary tightening, which gave the kiwi dollar a boost.

Sterling is trading at 1.97 this morning, and further losses are looking likely.

STERLING/CANADIAN DOLLAR:

Sterling lost three cents against the Canadian dollar with global stocks and oil prices rallying.

The riskier Canadian dollar is also rallying thanks to news out of the eurozone.

Market nervousness has been elevated of late, and yesterday’ decisions have triggered a real release of tension, which is benefitting commodity currencies such as the loonie and global equities.

The loonie’s direction today will be dictated by the advance US growth figure.

A stronger showing, which is expected, will stave off fears of another recession in Canada’s key trading partner.

This pair is trading at 1.5950.

EU Summit:

What we know so far

Thu, Oct 27 2011, 06:02 GMT

Fundamental Update

EU Summit:

what we know so far

The positive sentiment in the markets from this morning has been replaced with jitteriness and nerves as London packs up for the day. We are in for an NY afternoon of headline-driven market action and excess volatility with most markets moving together.

Greek haircuts and the banks:

The trigger for the sell-off in the euro today was news that the EU was deadlocked in talks with banks about the size of write downs for Greek debt.

Earlier today reports suggested that haircuts on Greek debt could top 50%.

This issue is one of many potential stumbling blocks we could come up against between now the Eurozone leaders’ press conference later tonight (initial reports suggest it could take place after dinner at 2200BST/ 1700 ET).

The Greek debt/ banks issue is crucial for two reasons.

Firstly, unless there is a strong re-capitalisation plan to help the banks’ deal with balance sheet losses then we could see another credit crunch, whereby banks stop lending, thwarting economic growth and throwing the global economy into recession.

The second point is that if Greece is not effectively dealt with then it could cause contagion, or the spread of problems, to Italy, Spain and maybe even France.

If banks are concerned that they stand to lose 50% of their investment in Greek debt then they may start dumping Italian, Spanish and even French debt to try and avoid a similar fate.

So the EU negotiations remain at a delicate stage.

Greece needs to reduce its debt burden, but not to such an extent that it spooks the markets.

Germany:

As the largest economy in the Eurozone it is the major player in this crisis.

The first hurdle to get over was a vote in the Bundestag that was crucial to pass since it allowed Merkel to go to Brussels and negotiate a beefed-up version of the EFSF.

The vote was passed as expected, but Germany won’t be contributing any more money to Europe’s bailout fund…

EFSF:

So where will the money come from?

One of two ways:

either Europe tries to do as best it can with what it’s got, and create an insurance programme to guarantee the first 20-30% of losses on future debt issuance, or it establishes a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that foreign sovereign wealth funds and possibly the IMF agree to invest in and buy up the bonds of Italy, Spain et al.

These two solutions may remind you of 2008 – monoline insurers were burnt by SPV’s!

Let’s hope the same doesn’t happen this time round.

What we are waiting for this evening:

Confirmation of how the EFSF will be increased in size and how large it will be.

What the role of the ECB will be in the whole programme

Whether banks will accept large haircuts on the Greek debt.

Risk of market disappointment?

Fairly high, in our opinion.

The EU leaders may only mark out the debt deal in broad brush strokes leaving it to EU finance ministers to fill in the details before the November 3rd G20 meeting.

Tonight’s deadline was always ambitious but deadlock between banks and EU leaders at this stage is a worrying sign.

As we have seen today, Europe has to deliver big to spark a market rally.

Since the currency bloc tends not to exceed expectations, so the risks are tipped to the downside in our view.

Whatever happens the big reaction over the next 12 hours will be in EURUSD, this cross is currently holding support at 1.3815.

Below here opens the way to a sharper fall towards 1.3650.

London Session/Fundamental Update:

The EU plan dissected

The markets’ positive reaction to the conclusion of the EU summit and announcement of the broad measures Europe will take to create a financial back stop to stem the sovereign debt crisis may be nothing more than a relief rally.

Whether or not stocks and the euro can sustain gains to year end depends on a whether investors (and the international community) believe that the Eurozone has done enough to stabilise the financial system and if the groundwork has been laid to deal with the longer-term structural issues that plague parts of the region.

Stabilisation in the near-term:

Without question, in the near-term progress was made.

Firstly, there was an injection of capital into Europe’s beleaguered banking system totalling EUR106bn.

This is below IMF and analyst estimates of capital requirements of EUR200-300 billion, but it is a step in the right direction and the stress tests (at last) included write-downs of sovereign debt, which the re-capitalisation plan some much-needed credibility.

Greek haircuts

This was the lynch pin of the whole deal.

If the banks weren’t re-capitalised then write-downs of Greek debt could not happen, let alone a disorderly default, without dragging the whole financial system down.

The size of Greek write-downs was the main stumbling block to negotiations last night and Merkel and Sarkozy scheduled an impromptu meeting with bankers at midnight to address the issue.

Reports from the politicians said that the bankers were told in no uncertain circumstances to accept the write downs or collapse under the pressure of a disorderly default.

However, this morning there are murmurs from the banks that the extent of the write downs (or the reduction of the net-present-value of Greek debt holdings) is still up for negotiation.

The markets are brushing off this detail, as it seems highly likely that banks will take larger haircuts on the Greek debt holdings, so the issue of re-capitalisation (which is fixed, as far as we know) is more important.

Is 50% enough?

The other sticking point with the Greek debt write-downs is that even at 50% they may not be enough.

This is estimated to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 120% by 2020;

but anything above 100% is considered unsustainable and haircuts may need to be 60% to make Greece’s debt burden sustainable.

However, it’s unlikely the banks will agree to any cuts on this scale.

Added to that the ECB won’t take any haircuts on its Greek bond holdings, which protects the integrity of its balance sheet but may also ignite the wrath of other bond holders who are subject to losses.

The EFSF:

A big bazooka?

The extension of the EFSF was considered the ultimate stabilising factor.

We know that the plan is to extend this to EUR1 trillion – four times its current size.

There are three questions we now need answered:

1, where the money will come from;

2, what the fund will be:

a monoline insurer or SPV;

and 3, what the fund will do.

Dial Beijing for cash:

Looking at the first point, hastily-arranged calls between the French President and the head of the EFSF with Chinese authorities in Beijing suggests that Europe is coming round to the idea that it needs outside help to save the Eurozone.

Other potential investors include cash-rich sovereign wealth funds and potentially the IMF, which would mean all contributing members of the IMF would help with funding.

What we do know is that Germany has said that it will not contribute any more funds, which leaves the rest of the world to fit the bill.

But this may have some benefits for potential investors as it would give them more influence in European affairs:

for example enforcing fiscal discipline and boosting trade links etc.

Will insurance work?

The second point is more complex.

For example:

will the fund be an insurer of European government debt?

Reports suggest that the fund could be used to insure the first 20-30% of Europe’s debt, but would this really be enough to entice investors especially since haircuts on Greek debt may top 50%. Thus, it may not trigger demand for Europe’s most troubled states’ credit.

Added to that, who would provide the insurance?

Right now there are only a few northern European countries with the finances to cover any trigger of the insurance scheme – France can’t afford to without threatening its credit rating.

What if Germany and co. fail to deliver on promises for other indebted countries?

Investors may well come to the conclusion that counterparty risk is too high to justify investing in European credit.

Europe’s SPV

The SPV idea may be easier to implement (as long as there are willing investors, of course!). We know that the plan is for the fund to be levered four times to EUR1 trillion, but now that Italy and Spain are drawn into the Eurozone fray is this enough to really stabilise the markets?

Some people note that the EFSF would need to be more than EUR2 trillion to provide a backstop big enough to bring Italy, and maybe even France out from the cold.

Structural issues:

a long-term problem

There was some progress here too. Italy has pledged to raise its retirement age from 65 to 67, which is vital for a country like Italy who has a rapidly aging population.

We need to see more action like this in other southern European nations to ensure long-term sustainable finances.

One area we haven’t heard much about is closer fiscal integration.

However, the EU summits this week were all about stabilising the current situation, we believe that meetings, Treaty changes and closer fiscal union will come in time.

Extra German support for its European neighbours has probably come at the price of closer economic ties.

However, this will require changes to the EU Treaty, which requires ratification by all 27 EU members, so could take years to implement.

Unless structural issues are addressed then this crisis is far from over.

We need some sort of fiscal ECB to act as a monitor that can veto national spending plans if they look unsustainable.

We also need proper tax collection systems in place in countries like Greece.

Overall, the Eurozone needs to re-balance, with southern states becoming a bit more Germanic, and Northern states becoming a bit more southern and spending more.

People have been calling for this since the start of this crisis – so expect progress to be slow.

Conclusion:

A plaster caste rather than a plaster

Events this week are definitely a step in the right direction, and although we believe this may be a relief rally in risky assets it may last for some time.

These plans are also much bigger than previous rescue efforts, and in that sense Europe has delivered what was expected of it, which it has failed to do in the past.

So, the actions from this summit – the 14th this year – could be considered more of a plaster caste than a plaster.

However, there are issues that remain.

In various interviews over the last few days I have been asked whether the 26th October will go down as a historical turning point for Europe.

My answer is no. My reason is that there is still so much work to do. For example, haircuts on Greek debt may need to be increased from 50% to stabilise the Greek debt load in the long term.

Added to this, the EFSF may not be big enough even with a 4-fold increase in its size to EUR 1 trillion.

So there could be many more summits and re-writes of the deal in the future.

But in the near term the picture is looking brighter than it did for risky assets a few months ago. EURUSD needs to break above 1.4099 – the 200-day moving average – for a target of 1.4500 to become realistic.

Right now this cross is still trapped between the 50-day moving average at 1.3850 and the 200-day just below 1.4100.

So we are still at risk of some whipsaw action as investors digest the rest of last night’s deal.

Stock markets also look fairly constructive;

however they have a long way to go, especially in Europe.

The Eurostoxx index jumped above the 100-day moving average at 2,422, the next major resistance level is 2,673 0 the 200-day sma. Overall, we continue to believe that European equities will underperform their US counterparts for the rest of this year.

Yesterday’s debt deal has a complex relationship with risk assets since stronger US data and signs that lose monetary conditions may persist around the globe for some time yet are also boosting investor risk appetite.

But, crucially, the risk of a systemic crisis has been averted, and the debt deal, even with its short-comings, may help to re-build economic, business and household confidence levels going forward.

This is providing some much-needed certainty to the markets.

Global stock markets soar on EU debt deal, US data

(AFP) – 1 day ago 

LONDON — Global stock markets soared in a massive relief rally Thursday after EU leaders agreed a deal to solve the eurozone debt crisis and data showed the US economy growing faster than expected.

Dealers said there may be many reservations about the deal but the immediate reaction was one of relief that European leaders had finally come up with a coherent response to a crisis threatening to sink the euro and the world economy.

The banks performed best, having been under intense pressure on concerns over their exposure to Greek government debt, with private sector creditors now agreeing to take losses of 50 percent on their holdings of Greek bonds.

This is combined with more than 100 billion euros in funds to help the banks cover their losses, ensuring the European banking system escapes the worst of any fallout.

Dealers said figures showing the US economy grew 2.5 percent in the third quarter, up sharply from the second and ahead of forecasts for around 2.3 percent, also gave sentiment a boost.

In London, the FTSE-100 index of top companies closed up 2.89 percent to 5,713.82 points while in Paris, the CAC-40 jumped 6.28 percent to 3,368.62 points.

In Frankfurt the DAX 30 gained 5.35 percent to 6,337.84 points.

Other European markets posted similar sharp gains after months of turmoil driven by worries the eurozone debt crisis could torpedo the euro and push the global economy back into recession.

In late trade, the euro was at $1.4190, up sharply from $1.3908 in New York late Wednesday.

The dollar fell to 75.77 yen from 76.21 yen.

In New York, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.53 percent at around 1600 GMT and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 2.35 percent.

Analysts there welcomed the US growth figures.

The report was "encouraging," said Peter Newland of Barclays Capital, noting that "the bulk of the rebound ... was centered in personal consumption, which was up 2.4 percent."

The prospect of the US consumer spending again raised hopes of a more firm-footed recovery after measly growth rates of 0.4 and 1.3 percent in the first two quarters sapped confidence.

"The bottom line is that the third quarter turned out to be a period of underlying strength," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist for Pierpont Securities.

"Decisions have been made in Europe, and even if we are short on detail Europe's leaders are talking the right game and the markets seem to like it," said said Kathleen Brooks, an analyst at traders Forex.com .

In Asian trade earlier Thursday, Tokyo closed up 2.04 percent and Hong Kong rallied 3.26 percent, helping set up Europe for a positive day.

"Overall, the agreement is welcome and addresses the fundamental issues underlying the eurozone debt crisis," said Barry Dixon, analyst at Davy stockbrokers.

"Whether the detail of the agreement is sufficient to quell market concerns over the medium term remains to be seen," he cautioned, sharing the concerns of many investors.

Despite the huge gains made on the markets, not all commentators were convinced.

"The plans announced by euro-zone policymakers ... look more like a peashooter than the 'bazooka' previously promised to tackle the region's problems," sceptial Capital Economics analysts wrote in a note.

"We have not altered our view that the crisis will deepen over the coming quarters, ultimately resulting in some form of break-up of the currency union."

EU debt crisis summit:

live report

By Robert MacPherson (AFP) – 2 days ago 

23:36 GMT:

With news of a draft deal in place for a one trillion dollar bailout fund, AFP is closing the live report on the summit meeting of eurozone leaders for Wednesday.

Please read on below for a summary of the day's developments.

22:53 GMT:

EU banks would need an extra 106 billion euros ($147 billion) to fulfil new capital requirements under a deal to tackle the eurozone debt crisis, the European Banking Authority (EBA) said.

"A preliminary and indicative aggregated capital target at the EU level, based on June?s figures and end-September sovereign bond yields, amounts to 106 billion euros," the regulatory body said in a statement.

European Union leaders agreed at a summit in Brussels earlier Wednesday to recapitalise banks so they can withstand the debt crisis, as part of a wider package to protect the single currency.

22:05 GMT:

Eurozone leaders plan to leverage the firepower of their bailout fund to one trillion euros ($1.39 trillion), said a diplomat familiar with a draft deal to be adopted at a summit Wednesday.

The figure will be mentioned in the final declaration the leaders must adopt at the end of the summit, expected to end late in the night, the diplomat said.

They were originally not expected to announce a figure.

2132 GMT:

Meanwhile, on Wall Street, US stocks closed with solid gains after a choppy session focused on the Brussels summit.

The Dow was up 162.42 points, or 1.39 percent, at 11,869.04.

"Little by little, we have become used to the difficulties the European have in reaching an agreement," said Gregori Volokhine of Meeschaert Capital Markets.

2130 GMT:

The summit is rolling into the night, with some informed speculation that it should wrap up at around 1 p.m. (2300 GMT) -- late by most people's standards, but not exceptionally late by EU standards.

Something to look out for in the coming days will be a trip to Asia later this week by Klaus Regling, chief executive of the European Financial Stability Facility, to discuss Chinese and Japanese participation in the fund.

"China is in," one diplomat said, and Brazil and Russia have also indicated that they could join in, too.

2048 GMT:

Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, has been talking about the 15-page letter of intent from his Italian counterpart, Silvio Berlusconi, and how it was received by the EU leaders.

"It actually left a good impression, which was accepted," he said, before adding:

"Things didn't go any further."

Europe had demanded that Italy slash its 1.9-trillion-euro debt, equal to 120 percent of GDP, and to enact structural reforms.

2020 GMT:

How do eurozone leaders dine out on a debt crisis?

We now know their dinner menu:

shrimp with eggplant as a starter, then roast turbot with spinach, followed by a trio of sorbets and coffee.

No-one could fault them for unhealthy eating.

2015 GMT:

Here's the state of play in Brussels at this hour:

Sarkozy and Merkel are ready to take the eurozone debt crisis in hand, even going to world bankers in person to ensure that the EU summit produces tangible results.

A deal in principle to beef up a eurozone rescue fund -- and a greenlight from the European Union's 27 leaders to recapitalise Europe's banks -- are among the accords struck during the much-anticipated summit.

No specific figures have been released, but finance ministers have given broad agreement to a 108-billion-euro ($150 billion) accord.

One source told AFP that "Merkel and Sarkozy will possibly go to meet the banks tonight."

2005 GMT:

Washington is closely watching what's happening in Brussels.

"We believe that the Europeans have the financial capacity to deal with this challenge and they need to meet that capacity with the political will that is necessary to meet it," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One.

"They need to take action that will conclusively deal with this challenge.

We continue to discuss with and urge our European counterparts to take conclusive action to deal with this problem in a timely fashion."

President Barack Obama has been in regular contact with top EU leaders, and he'll be seeing them in person at a Group of 20 summit in just over a week's time.

1959 GMT:

On financial markets, oil prices slumped as dealers digested fresh signs of weakening US energy demand and awaited the outcome of the EU summit.

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in December, dived $2.97 to close at $90.20 a barrel.

1917 GMT:

Eurozone leaders are ready to increase the firepower of its bailout fund "several fold" but will not give a headline figure, according to an EU source who is familiar with a draft version of the agreement that could emerge from the ongoing crisis summit.

1901 GMT:

The eurozone leaders are now sitting down to a late dinner, diplomats say. No word yet on what's on the menu.

1852 GMT:

Britain's David Cameron has been speaking in a bit more detail about the EU plan to recapitalise banks.

"We made good progress on the bank recapitalisation.

That wasn't watered down.

It now has been agreed," he said.

"It will only go ahead when the other parts of the full package go ahead -- and further progress on that needs to happen tonight."

1846 GMT:

Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister, was pessimistic when he spoke to reporters after the start of the summit.

"I don't think we will get a final solution tonight," he said, because the summit is dealing with things "technically very difficult" as well as "enormous amounts of money."

He said he thought "it's better to do it slowly in a way which creates long term confidence in the markets."

1843 GMT   According to a senior government source, France is in favour of China taking part in efforts to stem the eurozone debt crisis by helping boost its bailout resources.

Sarkozy will telephone China's President Hu Jintao on Thursday, the source added.

1836 GMT:

We are now hearing that France favours Chinese aid for the eurozone.

More on that in a moment.

1835 GMT:

A senior government source in Brussels says that Sarkozy and Merkel will Wednesday talk in person to world bankers to negotiate a "haircut" on Greek debt.

The source -- who is close to the talks but spoke on condition of anonymity -- said EU leaders were ready from Wednesday evening Brussels time to talk to the banks to cut a deal on the size of a debt writedown.

1825 GMT:

EU leaders have agreed a plan to recapitalise banks to enable them to withstand Europe's debt crisis, my colleagues in Brussels are reporting

But British Prime Minister David Cameron said the plan will only go ahead once eurozone leaders agree a "full package" of measures to protect the euro at their ongoing summit.

1807 GMT:

Italy is telling its European partners that it will present a growth plan by November 15, its domestic ANSA news agency is reporting, citing a letter of intent from Berlusconi to the Brussels summit.

The letter also reportedly includes a proposal to raise the retirement age to 67 from 2026 -- a measure negotiated with the prime minister's Northern League coalition partner.

1803 GMT:

Spanish journalists in Brussels are taking five-euro bets on the time that the summit will end. The most optimistic put their money on 10 p.m. Brussels time (2000 GMT);

the most pessimistic, 3 a.m. on Thursday if not later.

1800 GMT:

The eurosceptic Open Europe think tank is, well, sceptical about the summit.

This from their blog:

"The hope for a 'comprehensive plan' to save the eurozone, as originally touted by the eurozone leaders, looks to be a lost cause.

The best outcome we can hope for today looks to be a broad political agreement, with technical details left to be sorted at a later date."

1744 GMT:

The leaders of the EU member states that do not use the euro, including Britain, have left the summit chamber, leaving the euro zone to tackle the challenge at hand.

1740 GMT:

Images of the leaders arriving for the Brussels summit have gone up on the European Council's television website ( tvnewsroom.consilium.europa.eu ). From the cameras' vantage points, it seems that most of the leaders arrived without making statements, with the notable exception of Swedish Prime Minister Frederik Reinfeldt, who spoke for about 20 minutes -- and Sweden doesn't use the euro.

And when Angela Merkel said that much remains to be done, it was understood that the night would be long -- and the results less than decisive.

1723 GMT:

This observation from AFP's Laurent Thomet:

The man under the debt spolight, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, waved and smiled at reporters when he arrived at the summit, but he ignored their questions.

With one associate privately nicknaming him Nero, after the Roman emperor who fiddled while Rome burned, Berlusconi was under pressure from eurozone partners to bring a written pledge that he will implement measures to slash the country's 1.9-trillion-euro debt."

1714 GMT:

And there's this from Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny:

"The important thing here is that the full flexibility of the facilities that have been approved already be used now to bring certainty, and certainty of intent, for everybody."

Kenny added that it was his understanding that "some progress" had been made in a number of areas -- but which ones, he did not say.

1710 GMT:

On his way into the summit, Poland's Donald Tusk said:

"Everybody is waiting impatiently for the details, because it's all hell, not the devil, in those details."

1705 GMT:

The summit got underway about 20 minutes late on account of a last-minute huddle between Merkel and Sarkozy.

1700 GMT:

AFP's Christian Spillman, quoting a minister anonymously, tweets (and I translate from the French here):

"The eurozone at an impasse.

No agreement with the banks.

A Plan B is under study to avoid a massacre in the markets."

1656 GMT:

Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme -- a key player in the rescue of the Dexia bank earlier this month -- told reporters he hoped the summit would produce an outcome before financial markets in Europe reopen on Thursday.

1635 GMT:

The summit is now under way.

1622 GMT:

My colleague Claire Rosemberg reports:

"As leaders prepare to open.

Merkel is the last to sit down."

1612 GMT:

"We are near the moment of truth.

We must today take tangible decisions," said Luxembourg's long-serving prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the 17-nation euro-group of finance ministers.

1555 GMT:

There's mixed reaction from closing European stock markets after a day of choppy trade.

In Paris, the CAC-40 slipped 0.15 percent to 3,169.62 points and in Frankfurt the DAX 30 fell 0.51 percent at 6,016.07 points.

In London, the FTSE-100 index of top companies closed up 0.50 percent at 5,553.24 points.

There's currently a spectacular rainbow over the city's financial district, but maybe that's a coincidence.

1550 GMT:

Elsewhere in Europe, Latvian Finance Minister Andris Vilks says his country is on track to meet its 2014 target for adopting the euro.

Without referring to the debt crisis and the last ditch efforts to resolve it, Vilks said that inflation, one of the tests for bloc entrants, was seen as a concern but it was unlikely to upset Latvia's plans.

"I feel that we will technically meet the criteria and we will be able to react if inflation grows," said Vilks, whose austerity-focused government was sworn in for a new term yesterday.

1547 GMT:

"Our challenge today is not simply to save euro" but to "safeguard the ideals we cherish so much in Europe" post-World War II, Papandreou says.

1545 GMT:

The summit is about "saving the euro", Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou says on arrival.

1542 GMT:

A steady stream of leaders and officials arriving at the EU's Justus Lipsius building in Brussels now.

1530 GMT:

Cameron, who on Monday saw 79 of his Conservative lawmakers defy his orders to vote against a referendum on continued British membership of the EU, had fought for non-eurozone member states like Britain to be given a place at the summit.

"Some of the issues we will be discussing this afternoon are directly relevant to Britain in terms of strenghthening banks across Europe," he said, referring to negotiations both to write down scores of billions of euros in Greek debt and recapitalise the sector.

The London vote took place against a backdrop of intense negotiations on the eurozone debt crisis, which prompted French President Nicolas Sarkozy to criticise Cameron for interfering in the currency bloc's business during a stormy first Brussels summit on Sunday.

1520 GMT:

On the forex markets, the euro hit a seven-week dollar high this afternoon.

At 1315 GMT, the European single currency hit $1.3975, the highest level since September 8. But soon afterwards it sank as low as $1.3865 in volatile trade.

That compared with $1.3904 in New York late on Tuesday.

1517 GMT:

British Prime Minister David Cameron has also arrived, citing "British interests".

"I'm very glad to be here because it is in British interests that we actually solve this crisis," Cameron has told reporters.

"But in any event, we need to have the greatest possible support for the most comprehensive solution possible and that's what we will be discussing tonight."

1515 GMT:

"In any case, we are all coming here with the aim of achieving great progress," Merkel adds.

She also acknowledged that all details might not be worked out by the end of the summit, despite an initial bid to agree a grand plan to contain the crisis which could then be presented at the G20 summit next week in France.

1507 GMT:

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has arrived.

"There are still many problems to settle and negotiations to carry out, so the work is not yet over," she tells reporters.

1500 GMT:

Welcome to AFP's live coverage of events in Brussels, where European leaders are holding a crucial summit on the eurozone debt crisis.

With an hour to go before the summit opens, we'll bring you live updates from Brussels and reaction from around the world.

Here's a summary of key recent developments:

- Hopes are dimming that the gathering of European presidents and prime ministers will come up with a watertight deal to ward off fears of global recession.

- Draft conclusions leaked ahead of the talks show no deal on a figure for recapitalisation needs of banks.

Finance ministers had given broad agreement to a 108-billion-euro ($150 billion) recapitalisation tab last week.

- Senior diplomats have warned that negotiations with banks on a big write-down of Greek debt are proceeding slowly and that plans to boost Europe's bailout fund remain unclear.

- But China has injected a note of hope that the eurozone may be able to beef up the fund -- which currently stands at 440 million euros -- to more than a trillion euros, which would enable it to rescue large economies such as Italy and Spain.

Top EU diplomats tell AFP that China has agreed to invest in the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), a clear signal that attempts to solve the eurozone crisis are truly global.

- Russia has also offered to help boost the size of the bailout fund by acting with other countries through the International Monetary Fund.

- Global powers, from the United States to Japan and China, have pressed European leaders for a lasting solution to the debt crisis, ahead of the G20 summit in France on November 3 and 4.

- The spotlight will be firmly on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was told by his peers after a first summit on Sunday to return to Brussels with proof of rapid action to cut a debt mountain six times the size of that in Greece.

- Italian media report that Berlusconi has brought a 15-page letter outlining plans for reforms -- including a last-minute agreement with his Northern League coalition partner to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 in 2026 -- with him to Brussels today.

EU leaders must not dictate to ECB:

Merkel

(AFP) – 3 days ago 

BERLIN — European Union governments must not be allowed, at Wednesday's summit, to decide European Central Bank action, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference on Tuesday.

"We must not allow a misunderstanding, whereby politicians expect something from the ECB," Merkel said, referring to the role the central bank might play in helping deal with the eurozone debt crisis.

"We are negotiating with a view to have the ECB put forward its own point of view" on how it wants to help deal with the crisis, she said.

Germany is strongly attached to the ECB's independence and has long defended its right to be the final arbiter of monetary policy.

A statement currently being discussed for Wednesday's EU summit refers to demands by EU leaders that the ECB maintain support measures for banks and indebted eurozone governments.

"Germany does not accept such a sentence in the communique," Merkel told reporters following a meeting with Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed.

The proposed EU statement says:

"We fully support the ECB in its action to ensure price stability in the euro area, including its non-standard measures in the current exceptional financial market environment."

The ECB has so far bought a total 169.5 billion euros in eurozone government bonds since it first began such operations early last year as part of efforts to ease debt strains in the 17-nation bloc.

Current plans would see a newly boosted European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) take over responsibility from the ECB for buying the bonds of debt-troubled countries.

German newspapers on Tuesday expressed concern however that the EFSF would not have the firepower needed to deal with contagion if the crisis spreads further.

Quoting diplomatic sources, several newspapers suggested the ECB would have to continue helping the EFSF provide financial clout to deal with the crisis.

Merkel appears determined to maintain a firewall between the EFSF and the ECB which by its constitution is supposed to be free of all outside political influence.

Merkel seeks parliament backing before crunch EU talks

(AFP) – 2 days ago 

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel was poised Wednesday to win crucial backing from German lawmakers on beefing up the EU's bailout fund, hours before a crunch summit to tackle the euro debt crisis.

On what several German dailies called a "day of fate" for the euro, Merkel seemed sure to clinch broad support for plans to raise the firepower of the bloc's 440-billion-euro ($612-billion) war chest to stop the crisis spreading.

All the parliamentary groupings in the Bundestag lower house of parliament -- with the exception of the Linke far left -- have signed a text giving Merkel a mandate to scale up the fund without putting more money in -- out of the question in EU paymaster Germany.

The brief text, obtained by AFP, refers to two models being examined for bolstering the fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, or EFSF.

One would insure jittery investors against potential future losses from the debt of shaky countries, hopefully encouraging them to continue to buy bonds from the likes of Italy, Portugal and Spain.

The second calls for aid to be co-financed by public or private investors, including foreign countries.

"The two models are not mutually exclusive," the text says.

Earlier Wednesday, the China Daily reported that Beijing and other emerging powers had agreed to help the eurozone, citing a source close to EU decision makers.

Merkel was due to address the chamber at around 1000 GMT, ahead of a debate and the vote.

Following the vote, Merkel will fly to Brussels where EU leaders were due to gather from 1600 GMT.

After this meeting, the heads of the 17 eurozone countries will hold talks in a bid to thrash out a solution to what is seen as the worst economic emergency in the EU's history that threatens to tip the world into recession.

"It is going to be a long day," said Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert, on microblogging site Twitter.

Summit by summit, EU slouches slowly toward unity

By DON MELVIN, Associated Press – 23 hours ago 

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's plan to solve the worst financial crisis in its 50-year history may prove the tipping point for the continent's political journey from a collection of sovereign states into what some leaders hope will be a single world superpower.

The struggle to keep the euro together has been creating huge tensions between countries, causing some to believe the currency union could not last much longer.

But in the early hours of Thursday morning, EU leaders reached an agreement that suggested they are so committed to their common currency that they would rather give up some of their sovereign decision-making powers than see their economic union unravel.

"Last night was a crucial step," EU President Herman Van Rompuy told the EU legislature Thursday.

And that crucial step involves, in part, giving EU headquarters in Brussels some budgetary powers that have so far been the prerogative of national capitals.

For a start, the leaders of the 17 nations using the euro put Greece and Italy in budgetary straitjackets for monetary mismanagement, making sure that every retiree in Milan and unemployed construction worker in Athens now knows that the key to their future may no longer lie in their nation's capitals but in faraway Brussels.

What started as a joint currency ten years ago, meant to facilitate tourism, promote trade and discourage competitive devaluations, has been turned by the financial crisis into a wedge to enforce the cooperation the proponents of a fully united Europe once envisioned.

"Monetary policy alone is not enough to deal with the situation," Van Rompuy said.

"We cannot have a common currency, a common monetary policy, and leave everything else to the states involved.

That's why the 17 will have to go further."

Even if those fighting words lead toward more euroskepticism in some member nations, it may in the end matter little.

The leaders in charge of the weakest nations have looked over the edge of the financial abyss, and were happy to fall back into the forced embrace of the wealthier nations.

United they may stand.

Divided they would surely fall.

Rich countries like Germany and the Netherlands never hid their disdain from profligate neighbors but realized that cutting them loose would have undermined their joint currency — and, even more, their national economies.

At the next summit, on Dec. 9, the EU leaders will assess a plan on how to reach that degree of economic governance.

They say they may even consider treaty changes that will take more national sovereignty away from national capitals.

With a market of 500 million citizens and economic juggernauts like Germany and France, the EU has the potential to remain a global power for decades to come.

Two things might undermine this scenario.

Markets, which were buoyant on Thursday, might turn against the EU again if countries come under more fiscal pressure.

And elections might intervene.

"We have saved the eurozone and that's the good news and that's why the markets are reacting positively," said Marc Touati, chief economist at Assya Compagnie Financiere in Paris.

"But unfortunately we have only saved it temporarily.

In other words, in a few months, the same problems will return."

The leaders of Italy and France are weak, but new leaders there would not necessarily harm the integration project.

Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi only just averted a government collapse Tuesday over emergency measures demanded by Brussels, an issue so touchy that a fist fight erupted in parliament.

If Berlusconi goes down, however, a new coalition might well be equally pro-EU.

The same goes for France.

Sarkozy is down in the polls ahead of the May presidential elections, but Socialist challenger Francois Hollande could well take the same line if elected to take Sarkozy's.

And the diplomatic pressure in Europe often has the effect of turning opponents into, if not backers, at least neutral bystanders.

After pledging to let British voters have a say in any further expansion of European powers when he came into government, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron was forced into an embarrassing scramble this week to block a proposal to put the future of Britain's entire EU membership to a popular vote.

At the summit, he acknowledged that "it is very much in Britain's interest that we sort out these problems" of the euro crisis.

As one of the 10 EU nations outside the euro-area, Cameron has had the luxury to stand somewhat on the sidelines.

Britain too has had to recapitalize its banks over years past, so placing all the blame on the euro and Brussels often misses the point.

At the grass roots level, though, the issues are different.

In Athens, prominent left-wing deputy Dimitris Papadimoulis said this week's agreement would doom Greeks to a deeper recession.

"The deal puts Greece in a eurozone quarantine," he said.

"We are now locked in a system of continuous austerity, haphazard privatization, and continuous supervision by our creditors."

He also noted an inherent conflict of interest in the European debt plan.

"Those who monitor us do not have our interests in mind.

Their priority is that we pay back our loans," Papadimoulis said.

Elena Becatoros in Athens and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.

What is  the meeting about?

It's a summit of European Union country leaders in Brussels.

There are three big issues on the agenda:

How to cut Greece's debt mountain, how to bolster European banks to cope with losses and how to boost the firepower of the bailout vehicle known as the EFSF â€“ the European Financial Stability Facility.

Will the UK be there?

A meeting between EU finance ministers that was due to take place first to iron out some details has been called off. But all 27 EU leaders will still meet at 5pm UK time.

The final â€“ and more crucial session â€“ will be the meeting of the 17 eurozone leaders, which is still going ahead.

Are there any risks this summit could end in nothing?

It is possible.

Ahead of the meeting, German chancellor Angela Merkel will take the latest eurozone proposals to her parliament for a vote.

She needs backing from German politicians so she can go to Brussels with a mandate.

What is the EFSF?

The EFSF is the eurozone's rescue fund.

It is a special purpose vehicle set up with the sole purpose of being in a position to lend money to countries experiencing financial difficulty.

It has guarantees from eurozone member states, who say they will make good any debt incurred by the EFSF.

The EFSF issues debt to raise the money it lends to countries in need.

It's important to remember that all this rescue money is in the form of loans â€“ none of it is aid â€“ and in theory it all has to be paid back one day.

Why isn't the EFSF enough?

The original plan was for the EFSF to be able to lend â‚¬440bn (Â£380m).

Of that, a large chunk has been committed to Greece, Ireland and Portugal leaving around â‚¬310bn to play with.

That is too little to offer Italy or Spain should they need the same kind of help.

Market players and politicians in the US and UK argue that something like between â‚¬2tn and â‚¬3tn is needed.

What are the worries about Italy and Spain?

Italy is a guarantor of the EFSF but potentially, given the size of its debts relative to its economy, it may need money from the EFSF.

Italy guarantees about 20% of the EFSF.

If it drops out because it is applying for help, there are grave implications for Germany and France.

Their obligations to the EFSF would rise and that puts their AAA credit ratings at risk.

Spain's creditworthiness has also been called into question amid worries over mounting costs of restructuring its battered banking system, high unemployment and faltering growth.

Why all the worries about credit ratings?

When a credit rating drops, the cost of borrowing for a country rises as it is seen as a more risky borrower.

If France and Germany lose their credit ratings, so does the EFSF.

If the EFSF collapses, Germany and France are on the hook for real money.

Greece got help.

What's the situation there now?

Greece was where it all started and the economic situation there remains grim.

Greece's national output has contracted by 15% in the past three years as demand has been sucked out of the economy through spending cuts and tax rises.

Meanwhile, its debt will reach â‚¬357bn, or about 160% of gross domestic product, by the end of 2011.

Greece is struggling to keep up with all its debts, hence the talk of a possible Greek default.

Why is a Greek default bad news?

If Greece can't cover its debts the effects will be felt throughout Europe . Within Greece, if the country goes bankrupt virtually all banks will go bust given their exposure to sovereign debt.

Elsewhere in Europe many top banks are exposed to Greek debt, particularly in France.

There would also be repercussions for insurance companies and pension funds around Europe.

What is all this talk about haircuts?

In a bid to make Greece's debt mountain more sustainable, European officials have said that bondholders may have to accept "haircuts" â€“ write-offs on the Greek debts they are owed â€“ of up to 60% rather than the 21% agreed in July.

Banks warn that anything above 40% will further endanger the European banking system.

How did the financial system get in this mess?

One of the unforeseen consequences of the eurozone was that banks inside it would end up saddled with their own country's debt.

This is at the heart of the current problem.

A 60% haircut on Greek bonds will cripple Greek banks which are now facing full-scale nationalisation as a result.

How can governments protect banks?

There have been hopes that the European Union will recapitalise Europe's banks to ensure they can withstand the sovereign debt crisis.

Recapitalising banks means forcing or helping banks to increase their capital base.

How might recapitalisation happen?

One way is for the banks to dramatically scale down the size of their lending, which reduces the amount of capital they need.

The authorities would rather banks raise the extra capital on the markets by selling shares to investors â€“ but this seems very unlikely to happen.

Banks will then either have to ask their national governments to take stakes in them, or as a last resort turn to the EFSF.

Taxpayers are likely to end up involved one way or another.

sell-off

How much will they need in recapitalisation?

The figure now appears to be â‚¬108bn, almost half of what the International Monetary Fund had indicated.

What are the options for boosting the EFSF?

Officials have discussed various ways of leveraging the rescue fund without the governments that back it having to come up with bigger guarantees.

Firstly, making the EFSF more like an insurer so that it covers, for example, the first 20% of losses a bank could suffer on new government bonds issued by Italy and Spain.

That would effectively boost its firepower to around â‚¬1.5tn and hopefully restore appetite for buying eurozone bonds.

Secondly, there's the SPIV option â€“ where special purchase investment vehicles are established and partially guaranteed by the EFSF to lend money to eurozone countries and buy bonds in the primary market (when they are issued) and secondary market (where bonds already in issue are traded).

Who else could help?

European officials say the European Central Bank could do more by buying up the troubled bonds across the eurozone â€“ but the ECB has said that is not its job.

EU bailout deal buys some time but threat of recession lingers

Experts poring over the small print of the latest blueprint designed to end Europe 's sovereign debt crisis differed on Thursday about its long-term significance but they agreed on three things:

the summiteers have bought themselves some valuable time and they have left a host of loose ends to be tied up over the coming months, but they have not spared the eurozone from a pronounced slowdown next year, with a full-blown recession a possibility.

The initial market reaction was, as it tends to be, one of relief that the talks did not end in abject failure.

Investors have a lot riding on the ability of the eurozone to get its act together and are aware of the risks of the project falling apart.

Markets wanted to believe:

hence the increase in share prices on Thursday.

There, though, the unanimity ended.

At one end of the spectrum some analysts hailed the summit as a giant leap forward which would sort out the issues that have been undermining confidence in the single currency for the past year or more:

Greece, the wobbly banks, and the threat of a domino effect to Italy and Spain.

Azad Zangana, European economist at Schroders, said:

"These are very positive steps in the right direction which reinforces our view that European politicians are willing to take unprecedented action to keep the European monetary union together.

"We expect the eurozone economy to slow significantly by the end of the year, though the deal done may have helped avoid a second global credit crunch and a very deep recession."

At the other end of the spectrum, Jonathan Loynes, at Capital Economics, said:

"The plans announced by eurozone policymakers look more like a peashooter than the 'bazooka' previously promised to tackle the region's problems.

"We have not altered our view that the crisis will deepen over the coming quarters, ultimately resulting in some form of break-up of the currency union."

For the most part, however, analysts were more cautious, studying the small print before passing a definitive judgment.

"Overall, the package is a step in the right direction, but we do not expect it to calm markets permanently", said Guillaume Menuet at Citi.

The package will be judged on five key criteria:

will it make Greece viable;

can banks increase their capital without causing a credit crunch;

will money actually be stumped up for the European Financial Stability Facility;

will the heat come off Italy and, finally, will it improve Europe's growth prospects?

Under the terms of the plan, there is a voluntary agreement among Greece's private sector creditors to write off 50% of the country's debt.

By 2020 that should reduce Greece's debt to 120% of its annual income â€“ down from the current level of 180% and in line with that of Italy.

Even assuming the private sector banks follow through on what is, after all, a voluntary commitment, Greece's debt levels look high for a country mired in recession.

The good news for Athens is that it will get additional financial help from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union that will allow the bills to be paid until 2014.

But the consensus on Thursday  was that Greece's debts will not be sustainable even after the latest agreement.

Bank recapitalisation can happen the easy way or the hard way. The easy way would be if sovereign wealth funds in China and the Middle East could be persuaded to take a stake in those European banks that would be left short of capital in the event of the debt crisis deteriorating, with any additional funds raised by selling off unwanted assets, such as the banks' overseas subsidiaries.

The hard way will be if banks de-leverage, either by refusing to extend credit or by calling in loans.

If the banks do it the hard way, recessionary pressure will intensify.

Europe is also hopeful that Beijing will be prepared to contribute to the Special Purpose Investment Vehicle (SPIV), one of the two proposed ways of increasing the firepower of the EFSF.

An insurance fund, which will indemnify investors against the first 20% of any losses incurred by the purchase of sovereign-country bonds is the other.

There are a number of question marks about the EFSF:

the â‚¬1tn figure is half of what the IMF has estimated is needed;

there is no guarantee that the Chinese will agree to fund it and the 20% indemnity looks too low considering that investors are expected to take a 50% hair cut in Greece.

Stuart Thomson, chief economist at Ignis Asset Management was scornful of the planned leveraging up of the EFSF.

"The aptly named SPIV spells the true nature of this policy:

it's a massive confidence trick," he said.

The focus on Italy in the summit communique reflects concern that the euro area will continue to struggle without action to sort out the problems of its third largest economy.

Italy is heavily indebted, slow growing and vulnerable to the loss of investor confidence that sent borrowing costs spiralling for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

Silvio Berlusconi promised structural reform, including an increase in Italy's pension age;

markets will be looking to see whether the words are backed up by action and, assuming they are, whether the reforms make any difference.

That leads to the final issue:

growth, seen by Trevor Greetham, Portfolio Manager at Fidelity Multi Asset Funds as the "critical test".

The equation is simple:

with growth, Europe will stumble towards a resolution of its crisis.

Without growth, the crisis will re-emerge in 2012.

3.39pm:

This blog has now closed - it will continue here .

3.15pm:

Time to say goodbye.

My colleague Dominic Rushe in New York is taking over shortly.

Many thanks for all your great comments.

3.12pm:

Time for a look at the markets.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is trading 87 points higher at 11793, a 0.75% gain.

The FTSE has edged nearly 10 points higher to 5535, a 0.2% increase.

Germany's Dax and France's CAC have climbed about 1% each, reversing earlier losses.

3.06pm:

Some news on the haggling between banks and politicians over the writedown private investors will be forced to take on Greek government bonds.

The lead negotiator for the banks said Greek government bondholders had made a "significant" new offer, without giving details, however.

A spokesman for the Institute of International Finance said:

"A significant new offer was made by Mr Charles Dallara, IIF managing director, on behalf of private investors in discussions yesterday.

The offer was for a debt exchange on a voluntary basis in support of Greece.

I am not able to elaborate at this point."

Banks are being urged to take a loss of 50% plus on their Greek debt holdings, but have been resisting this.

2.53pm:

More from David Gow in Brussels.

Well, the Bundestag may have delivered Angela her crushing majority and her red lines but, down the street from the circus tent, the atrium of the Justus Lipsius building, senior EU officials are still locked in negotiations with private creditors over those haircuts.

Someone in the know tells me the EU would like 60%, would settle for 50% and won't go below 40% - the latter being the bondholders' last offer.

The EFSF, meanwhile, will be composed of two elements - insurance and special purpose investment vehicle - and these will be combined in a single package with input from the IMF, Chinese (talks start in Beijing on Friday with Klaus Regling, EFSF chief) et al. Enda Kenny has told Irish MPs Ireland wants a piece of this action to reduce its debts.

These people are pretty sanguine about the outcome and so are the Portuguese journos who are running a bet on when the eurozone summit ends:

only â‚¬5 each.

Your correspondent joined a cluster around 2315CET.

The Italians are still worried sick.

Berlusconi will turn up with his list of "commitments" and hand them over 15 minutes before the shenanigans start.

These are due to be enshrined within two pages of communique on economic governance.

2.43pm:

Another update from John Hooper in Rome:

Silvio Berlusconi has left Palazzo Grazioli, his home in Rome, to fly to Brussels for tonight's meetings.

He had previously spent an hour or more with some of his ministers, including a senior member of the Northern League, in an effort to put some more substance into the letter he is taking to the EU summits.

Gianni Letta, a junior minister and former newspaper editor who is Berlusconi's all-purpose Mr Fixit, had said earlier that some retouching was needed.

Indeed.

If the promise of bringing the pensionable age up to 67 by the year 2026 is the jewel in the crown, as indicated by government sources late last night, then the letter is a pretty scanty garment with which to cover the prime minister's blushes.

The existing plan was to get to 65 by the same date.

2.15pm:

Germany's Bundestag has approved the motion to strengthen the euro bailout fund EFSF by leveraging it, with a large majority.

Chancellor Angela Merkel will be relieved as she needed the mandate ahead of the leaders summit in Brussels this evening.

The vice president of the lower house of parliament said 503 lawmakers had voted in favour of the motion, 89 voted against and 4 abstained.

The motion states that the European Central Bank will no longer need to buy bonds on the secondary markets, and that the rescue fund cannot be financed through the ECB.

1.46pm:

Back to the German parliament, where they are finally voting on the EFSF enlargement, after a lengthy debate, which lasted nearly three hours.

Earlier, Merkel indicated that European leaders should agree on a 50% writedown in the face value of Greek debt for private bondholders.

She said she would "work towards reaching sustainable decisions this evening".

Meanwhile, Slovakia's prime minister Iveta Radicova said private investors should accept a haircut of more than 50%, as she was leaving for the EU summit in Brussels.

Banks have been haggling with politicians over the scale of write-offs.

The Greek finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said banks and insurers would receive â‚¬15 in cash and â‚¬35 in 30-year 6% coupon bonds for every â‚¬100 of debt they own, according to the Greek newspaper Kathimerini.

1.20pm:

What are we looking for at the summit?

Elsa Lignos, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets has compiled this list:

1) Greece, the haircut and second bailout.

It looks like we may not get a final figure today which would be a disappointment for markets expecting progress.

A Greek paper suggests 50% is on the table (with no EFSF guarantees but with a mixture of cash and bonds in the swap) but also says the communiquÃ© is likely to make a more general reference to "haircuts of 50-60% and a long-term target for debt/GDP in 2020".

And still no conclusion on whether this can be done "voluntarily" without triggering a credit event.

(2) Bank recaps.

After Sunday's summit, a figure of â‚¬108bn did the rounds though it can't be possible to finalise it until the Greek haircut is known.

(3) New structure for the EFSF:

Here we should hear more detail about the two plans on the table â€“ the insurance option (to guarantee new issuance) and the SPIV (which aims to attract external investors and can also buy secondary market debt).

But what can't be known is the "total size" of EFSF v3.0 until external investors show their interest (which may take several weeks).

Overnight a Chinese diplomat in Brussels said China supports the EU efforts but there is nothing concrete on investing in an EFSF SPIV.

Meanwhile EFSF Chief Regling is travelling to China on Friday for talks with buyers.

(4) Finally Italy is expected to present concrete measures to reduce its deficit/debt.

The Italian cabinet is said to have reached agreement late yesterday.

This morning Italian paper La Repubblica said part of the deal is that PM Berlusconi will step down in Jan (though he has made promises like this before).

Still we will be waiting to see how realistic the measures are, e.g. whether there has been compromise on raising the retirement age.

Also on the agenda will be reforms to economic governance though they typically fail to rouse markets.

Beyond the Greek PSI deal (at the margin positive if agreed, negative if not), markets will take their cue from the general level of detail in the final communiquÃ©, clearly the more, the better, though there is recognition parts of it (the total size of the SPIV) will have to wait.

1.17pm:

David Gow in Brussels has tracked down the draft summit statement(s).

Just to be clear:

that's the draft for the first meeting at EU-27 level, not for the 17 eurozone leaders who meet later (around 1930CET for dinner).

As one wag put it:

"It'll finish at 9;

can't say whether that's pm or am."

Bet the Congress of Vienna wasn't as exhausting as this Circus of Brussels.

Just when you're looking for clarity on today's events along come two draft statements in quick succession and, of course, they merely confirm what we already know about banks and "urgently needed" measures for restoring confidence in the banking sector and "strengthening prudential control".

The "consensus" on banking package, to be endorsed by the EU-27 leaders later on today, talks about avoiding a credit crunch and safeguarding the flow of credit to the real economy.

And it spells out that a "simple repetition" of the 2008 experience with "full national discretion" is not on or adequate and a "truly co-ordinated" approach at EU level is required regarding entry criteria, pricing and conditions for ensuring liquidity.

The capital target is, of course, set at 9% (after accounting for market valuation of sovereign debt exposure) and has to be achieved by June 30, 2012 (nine months from end-September).

Interestingly enough, national supervisors, acting with the EBA, "must ensure that banks' plans to strengthen capital do not related to excessive deleveraging" and credit keeps flowing to the real economy.

Finally, eurozone countries alone can use EFSF funds as a last resort for recapitalising banks and these should be "subject to constraints regarding the distribution of dividends and bonus payments until the target has been achieved."

And, of course, state aid rules shall apply.

All in all, nothing new there.

Still waiting for the real news:

size of haircuts and scale of EFSF firepower (bazooka or pea-shooter?) So far, we're talking 50% for the first and â‚¬1.4trn for the latter.

1.16pm:

Back in London, M&G's Stefan Isaacs comments on the eurozone mess â€“ "time for inflation protection".

Travelling through Switzerland I can't help but think that politicians both here and in the UK have a lot to thank their predecessors/electorates for.  The relative safe-haven status enjoyed by both economies reflects, at least in part, the arm's length relationship with the euro.

(Swiss readers may not take kindly to being compared with us Brits, but you take my point.)

The eurozone policy makers who are currently trying to thrash out some sort of 'deal' have an almost impossible task on their hands.

Despite a belated recognition that some leadership is much required, the reality is that a comprehensive solution won't be reached.

We've talked before (see here) about the inherent dangers in any monetary union absent fiscal union.

Are the French, Italians, the Spanish, even the Greeks ready to be governed by Berlin?

Or indeed, if Greece et al are willing to give up all sovereignty, are the Germans willing to take responsibility for the deficit countries of Southern Europe ?  Fiscal union requires both the debtors and creditors to be compliant.

The foundations of the building are unsafe;

replacing the roof may help keep the rain out but it won't ultimately stop the house collapsing.

Absent fiscal union and two outcomes spring to my mind;

euro breakup (of some form) or the monetisation of deficits.

The former would likely see a return to 1930s depression economics, the latter some would argue risks a rerun of the 1920s Weimar experience.

While we're certainly not predicting a rerun of 1920s hyperinflation, it will be the temptation to inflate that will win out. The structural adjustments required of  many European economies will likely prove too big a pill to swallow.

German led protests will fall on deaf ears, and German resignations from the ECB will make little difference.

Inflating away liabilities will prove an easier sell for economies that have binged on debt and leverage for decades.

Time to visit some inflation protection?

Given there is so little inflation priced into bond markets right now, I think so!

1.14pm:

The German debate continues.

Gerda Hasselfeldt, head of the conservative CSU parliamentary group (which belongs to Merkel's government coalition), has just insisted that the EFSF "must not become a money printing machine".

1.07pm:

On a lighter note, our Rome correspondent John Hooper has sent us this:

A bit of light(-ish) relief prompted by the Northern League's veto on any change in the system that allows some Italians to retire unusually early (and which means Silvio Berlusconi will return almost empty-handed to Brussels later today).

Ushers in the Italian parliament had to step in this morning to prevent two deputies coming to blows over a remark by the speaker, Gianfranco Fini, last night on television (Italian speakers can watch the video here ). Fini reminded viewers that the wife of Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Northern League, was also in retirement -- and had been since 1992 when she gave up work at the ripe old age of 39.

League deputies were furious.

Just before the scuffle with a Fini supporter, one of them accused the speaker of "offending those who took advantage of pension regulations that were in effect at the time."

1.01pm:

And the news from the US is that we are expecting the markets there to open up, after sharp falls yesterday.

The S&P 500 was down 2% on Tuesday while the Dow fell 1.7%. Stock index futures indicate a 78-point climb at the open for the Dow, and a seven point rise for the S&P 500, rises of 0.7% and 0.6% respectively.

12.45pm:

While we follow that German debate, a few details of a draft statement from EU heads of state is leaking out.

The upshot is that banks will have to have a capital ratio of 9%, by June 30, 2012.

In order to raise capital, banks should use private sources first, be restricted in what dividends and bonuses they can pay until the capital targets are met, Reuters is saying.

11.53am:

Helen Pidd, who is at the Bundestag in Berlin, has sent us this:

Angela Merkel was really banging home her demand for changes to the European treaties in order to correct the 'weaknesses' in the European union's foundations.

She says it's defeatist nonsense to suggest any changes will result in a decade's bickering, pointing out that it only took six months for German reunification to be planned in 1990.

She was heckled a lot by MPs from Die Linke party, who have announced they will vote against the euro rescue plans later.

But she was applauded by her own coalition for tough talk on ensuring misbehaviour by euro countries in the future must be punished.

Merkel received a big round of applause for her speech, which lasted for almost 40 minutes.

She closed by saying that another 50 years of prosperity in Europe was "not to be taken for granted", then repeating her mantra that "if the euro fails, Europe fails."

No one knows the consequences of failure, she said.

Frank-Walter Steinmeier from the SPD is the first politician to speak now in the pre-vote debate.

11.46am:

The German chancellor says the risks related to EFSF enlargement is "defensible" - in fact, "it is not defensible and not responsible NOT to take this risk".

In an emotional final appeal to parliamentarians, amid much applause from her own coalition, Merkel says:

What is good for Europe is good for Germany ... Another half century of peace and prosperity in Europe is not to be taken for granted.

If the euro fails, Europe fails.

11.44am:

Merkel says the situation is serious and there are no simple solutions to the crisis - the current issues "will occupy us for years to come".

11.37am:

In passing, Merkel says "we're in an existential crisis".

Regulation of financial markets is one of the main challenges which hasn't been tackled yet. She will push for a tax on financial transactions at the Cannes summit.

11.33am:

Merkel confirms that Germany has had its way and that any models that involve the ECB are not on the agenda tonight - i.e. she is ruling out using the ECB to provide more liquidity to sovereign debt markets.

See earlier post [10.27am] . She also stresses that there won't be any new money for the eurozone bailout fund - Germany's contribution of â‚¬211bn in guarantees to the EFSF will not change.

11.26am:

Back to the German parliament.

Merkel is setting out measures needed to prevent the eurozone debt crisis spreading.

First, recapitalisation of European banks, which will go a long way to helping prevent systemic risk.

Second, a "firewall" - she used the English word - to ward off contagion from Greece's debt problems.

"Every country needs to do its homework."

11.24am:

This just in from David Gow in Brussels.

The Commission confirms the Berlusconi letter has not yet arrived "but we are confident we will receive the letter from the Italian authorities before the end of the day".

Pressed by Italian journos, the spokesman says Rome must set out concrete and detailed measures to restore confidence in financial stability of the eurozone.

Also: "We need a deal tonight.

What we expect is a credible political answer to the key questions on the table".

11.20am:

Merkel notes that Ireland is "on a good path" and Greece has started making much needed reforms.

She says that "a lot is being asked of the Greek people and they deserve our respect".

She says the troika's three-month reports on Greece are not enough, calling for permanent monitoring of Greece, adding that a debt writedown alone will not solve the country's problems.

The goal of tonight's summit discussions must be a solution that puts Greece on a debt to GDP ratio of 120% by 2020.

"We must help Greece back onto its feet."

11.16am:

Merkel has started making the case for the latest changes to the eurozone rescue fund.

MPs applaud when she says that Germany has emerged from the crisis stronger than it went into it and unemployment is the lowest in 20 years.

It's clear that Germany can't do well if Europe doesn't.

It is therefore important that Europe emerges from the crisis stronger than it went into it. Europe must become a 'stability union'.

11.14am:

Angela Merkel just got up to address the Bundestag.

11.06am:

The debate in the German Bundestag is about to start - apparently at 11.10. You can watch it live here .

11.04am:

Charles Jenkins, economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, has sent us his thoughts on Italy.

The fact that the Italian government is weak and divided and only capable of taking policy initiatives to tackle its fiscal and economic problems when put under enormous external pressure to do so is a major cause of the present crisis in the euro zone.

The indecisiveness of the government has led to a loss of confidence of potential private purchasers of government debt.

It also makes it more difficult for the other euro zone countries to put in place the required massive increase in public sector support available from the European Financial Stability Facility since this requires the sanction of German and other parliaments.

It does now seem that Italy is prepared to contemplate much more serious cuts to the cost of public administration than previously mooted as well as further pension reforms and a liberalisation of labour markets.

But whether these proposals will be made sufficiently specific to be credible and be both agreed without watering down and effectively implemented still remains to be seen as eurozone heads of government hold a crucial summit today.

In the circumstances the summit is not likely to produce a sufficiently robust agreement to reassure markets that eurozone leaders are on top of the situation.

10.49am:

Our Rome correspondent John Hooper says the Italian treasury this morning auctioned â‚¬8.5bn of short-term debt (six-month bills known as BoTs) -- and the interest rate was almost 0.5% higher than at the last comparable auction in September.

Ominous. The latest rate was 3.535%.

10.27am:

A phrase calling on the European Central Bank to continue its "non-standard measures" will likely be dropped out of conclusions drafted ahead of the summit following Germany's opposition, a senior eurozone source told Reuters.

EU sources had said the phrase on non-standard measures referred to the ECB buying bonds of distressed euro zone sovereigns in the secondary market.

But German Chancellor Angela Merkel intervened on Tuesday by saying that had not been agreed with Germany and instead she called for a statement by the ECB on what it wants to do.

"It looks like Germany got its way over France.

The phrase will likely not be in the next draft," the source said.

10.23am:

The latest from the Bundestag is the vote will be around 14.15 CET, so 1.15 London time, says Helen Pidd in Berlin.

It's a moveable feast.

I will amend the agenda lower down again ...

10.07am:

Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC Partners, writes in her morning comment:

"It is always best to "Under Promise and Over Deliver... But it seems that European policy makers are doing the opposite..."

We were promised a master plan two weeks ago and yet here we are, even after extra meetings, expecting to be disappointed.

Its the Finance Ministers and their financial calculators that help give us the nitty gritty of any rescue plan and they are a no-show for today's event.

Meanwhile markets are adopting a "wait and see" approach, even though expectations are pretty low as to what will be achieved from today's latest get together.

Grand, bold statements yes, and lots of talk of "saving the Eurozone" and "solidarity" but in reality, if you ignore the PR managed quotes, what will actually have been achieved?

Its highly unlikely that it will be a large volume day for the share market although any who have ridden the rally from 5000 to 5500 in the FTSE since the beginning of the month, may be tempted to take some profits.

Ahead of the meeting, most traders will be reluctant to be take large positions, given the volatility of equity markets currently and the unpredictability of politicians.

Equity markets are also pretty unforgiving at the moment - Amazon's shares traded 15-20% lower in after hours trading after disappointing figures last night.

And there is more caution from the raft of European corporate results today with concerns from Peugeot, and another profit warning from Carpetright (fifth of the year).

The long winded and dysfunctional European decision making process is being highlighted by the current crisis.

And the country with the purse strings is more hampered than most with Angela Merkel having to return to her parliament to get approval for her position (let alone the restrictions imposed by the German Constitution).

But with 17 democracies in the Eurozone and 27 in the European Union, how else can it be?

9.49am:

Italian business morale weakened this month to the lowest level since January 2010.

National statistics office ISTAT's business confidence index fell to 94 in October, from 94.5 in September.

Meanwhile, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index for the eurozone declined by 0.7% in September to 105.9, following a 1.3% fall in August and a 0.1% drop in July.

Jean-Claude Manini, the Conference Board's senior economist for Europe, said:

The further decline of the Euro Area Leading Economic Index, coupled with widespread weakness among its components has pushed the index into recessionary territory.

The deterioration of consumer and business confidence has been much stronger than the decline in real measures.

Nonetheless, if the latest policy intentions to contain the debt crisis fail to reassure investors and businesses, it will be much harder to prevent decline in measures such as industrial production and retail trade.

9.42am:

It looks like Angela Merkel's RegierungserklÃ¤rung has been postponed until noon German time (11.00 UK time), says our Berlin correspondent, Helen Pidd.

9.39am:

Our man in Rome John Hooper has the latest on the situation there:

This is going to be a day of fevered rumours, so perhaps we can start by sorting out the wheat from the chaff in the story of Berlusconi's reported pledge to resign.

All the Italian newspapers today are reporting that he and his chief ally, Umberto Bossi of the Northern League, cut a deal last night to increase the age at which Italians qualify for an old age pension to 67 â€“ but only in 2026.

The education minister, Mariastella Gelmini told a TV interviewer the idea was to raise the age "for men and women in the public sector and the private, gradually increasing the pensionable age from 2012 to 2025".

That only represents a modification of existing plans, and according to most reports this morning, it is the sole firm pledge contained in a long (14- or 15-page) letter that Berlusconi will take to Brussels to set before his fellow-European leaders.

No one thinks they will be much impressed.

The key point is that Bossi has successfully blocked Berlusconi's plan to abolish Italy's separate time-in-work pensions, which allow some people in Italy to retire unusually early.

The opposition La Repubblica alone reports that, in order to get this minimal concession from his ally, the prime minister entered a "secret pact" to stand down in January, opening the way for elections in March.

But this has been the expectation in Italy for months now, and the paper's story has prompted little interest here.

La Repubblica, by the way, is not making much of its scoop on its website . The link to the story is seven lines below the picture of Bossi where it says "Alle urne a marzo".

9.34am:

My colleague Katie Allen has done this handy Q&A on the European summit - what is the meeting about, what are the risks, what is a haircut and what happens if not enough progress is made?

9.21am:

A quick round-up of today's papers.

The Sun has the headline "Hope EU have a happy B-Day [that's B for bailout]" with a handy debt crisis for dummies guide.

The Financial Times has "Fears euro summit could miss final deal - Talks on Greek bondholder haircuts remain inconclusive".

It is better to take time to agree a policy that will work than to rush through an ill-considered response.

Leaders should bear in mind at Wednesday's scheduled summit that Europe cannot afford another half-baked solution dressed up as the real thing.

Meanwhile, the Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott writes :

Europe has form when it comes to long, drawn-out summits and diplomats once took nine months to thrash out a political settlement in a time of crisis.

This, though, was the Congress of Vienna between September 1814 and June 1815, long before leaders had to worry about credit default swaps, bond spreads and the instant judgment of the ratings agencies.

Now they do, but Europe's leaders have been moving at a pace that would have been familiar to Metternich and Castlereagh.

German news magazine Der Spiegel talks of a "Fateful day for the world economy".

The whole world looks to the chancellor.

On Wednesday, her rescue plan must pass the Bundestag.

Then she meets with eurozone leaders in Brussels.

Everywhere people hope for a breakthrough - because a delay to the rescue measures would be a serious blow to the global economy.

By contrast, France's Le Monde is leading on the French banks, saying they have confirmed that they can recapitalise themselves.

9.08am:

Paul Donovan at UBS has launched his latest podcast :

The 14th emergency summit of the Euro area has profound economic consequences.

In a utopian idyll today's decisions would be taken by economists.

(In a utopian idyll economists would rule the world and the crisis would not exist because the Euro would not exist).

8.59am:

The FTSE is now 17 points higher at 5542, a 0.3% gain.

Germany's Dax is up 16 points, or 0.27% and Italy's FTSE MIB  has gained 0.5%. Elsewhere, France's CAC has edged 4 points lower, or 0.1%, Spain's Ibex has lost 0.4% and Portugal's PSI has shed 0.2%. Gold has rallied a one-month high on growing doubts that the EU summit will be able to resolve the eurozone debt crisis.

Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital, said:

Traders remain jittery and volumes stunted as the market waits for Europe's leaders to finally put a lid on the debt crisis.

The recapitalization of European banks and a 50% haircut on Greek debt seems to be on the cards and could be just enough to ease investor concerns.

But the market will also look for measures to ring-fence Italy and Spain from any contagion effect.

If deemed inadequate, we could see a return to the volatility of three months ago.

8.52am:

Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income at Evolution Securities, says he feels like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.

It seems that every day I wake up, get to work and write the same stuff about the European sovereign crisis.

We seem to be going through the same "market concerns, leaders talking the talk, meetings arranged, large numbers mentioned, proposals announced to end the crisis, sugar rush reaction followed by disappointment as it becomes clear that the proposals will not bring about a lasting solutionâ€¦and repeat".

But this is the day I wake up to a new dawn.

Yes, it's the day of the Grand Plan!

Though I have to admit that there seems to be a lot of work being left to the last minute.

It is likely that they will want to announce some kind of agreement today but it is likely to be light on specifics.

The cancellation of today's finance ministers meeting announced yesterday lowered expectations as it seems there was no details for the finance ministers to work on. It is reported that the voluntary haircut on Greek bonds has not been finalised and unless progress is made today the concluding statement will refer to a range with 50%-60% being mentioned, but not actually agreed upon.

The 'leverage' of the EFSF fund is also said to need further consultation with investors before plans can be finalised, although we might hear more details when Mrs Merkel addresses her parliament this morning.

We said on Monday that it would be a challenge to obtain financial commitment from outside parties by Wednesday for the proposed special purpose vehicle and it looks as if that is the case.

We expect today's deal to include the much talked of guarantee scheme as well as the SPV, but it is questionable whether it will be possible to specify by how much the two schemes will be able to stretch EFSF funds.

There is scope for great disappointment, though if there seems to be general agreement on the bigger scheme and a tight timeframe for the details to be worked out markets may give them the benefit of the doubt.

However with Italian yields near 6% and Spanish yields rising even in the short auction held yesterday market confidence is key and it may be fading further without more details on how these schemes are going to help Italy refinance over â‚¬300bn in bond redemptions over the next three years.

I have a funny feeling that I will wake up tomorrow to the song "I Got You, Babe"â€¦

8.35am:

Our Berlin correspondent Helen Pidd is cycling to the Reichstag to get a good seat for the Bundestag debate.

She has sent us this:

Today is going to be very busy for Angela Merkel.

At 9:30am CET (8:30 BST) she will chair the weekly cabinet meeting;

at 11am CET (10am BST) she will address Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, and explain her position on how Europe should best proceed in the debt crisis.

After a debate, parliament will vote â€“ a result is expected around 12:30pm CET. Then she will hotfoot it to Brussels in time for the two euro summits, one with all 27 EU leaders and another with just the 17 eurozone gang.

It's going to be a long, long day.

The expectation here is that Merkel will easily win the vote, even if around 16 MPs from her coalition are likely to rebel.

She can afford 19 rebellions from her own side and still win the so-called "chancellor majority", which means winning a motion without relying on help from the opposition.

In this case, both the Greens and the Social Democrat (SPD) opposition have indicated support for the bill, so it is in little danger of being rejected.

"The chancellor will go to Brussels today strengthened by a clear and very broad mandate," Peter Altmaier, parliamentary floor leader of Merkel's conservative bloc told German radio this morning.

The chancellor is expected to reassure parliament that German guarantees will not exceed the â‚¬211bn already committed to the bailout fund.

Addressing her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and its Bavarian sister party the CSU, on Tuesday, she told MPs the European Central Bank would not be turned into a "money printing machine".

She also insisted the risks Germany would face were "vertretbar", which means justifiable or maintainable.

Her finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble told the same meeting that Germany insists troubled euro countries would only be allowed to dip into the rescue fund if they promised to carry out "reform programmes".

In her Bundestag speech today, Merkel is likely to confirm German support for leveraging the EFSF up to a trillion euros and beyond, while stressing that Germany's liability will remain unchanged.

Having on Tuesday told reporters that she was opposed to a phrase in the draft summit conclusions urging the ECB to continue using "non-standard measures in the current exceptional financial market environment", the chancellor is expected to emphasise Germany's demand for central bank independence.

8.30am:

Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has agreed to step down by January and to bring elections forward to 2012, the I talian daily la Repubblica reported .

Berlusconi agreed with Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, which holds the key to Berlusconi's parliamentary majority, to hold early elections in March in exchange for reforms on pensions, liberalisation and bureaucracy.

8.23am:

The FTSE has just turned negative, down more than 5 points at 5519.

Looks like trading will be volatile until we know more about the outcome of the summit.

8.18am:

The market is trading sideways ahead of the EU summit, with the FTSE up nearly 4 points at present at 5529.

France's CAC has also edged 4 points higher, and the Dax over 1 point.

Lothar Mentel, chief investment officer at Octopus Investments, told Reuters:

I'm convinced it's going to disappoint because they can't quite pull the rabbit out of the hat yet, though they will probably get something better over time.

Markets will react badly.

8.01am:

Here is today's agenda:

â€¢ Italian Business confidence 9:00;

bond auction

â€¢ CBI Industrial trends survey for the UK 11:00

â€¢ German chancellor Angela Merkel speaks to Bundestag at 11:00;

vote on changes to EFSF expected at 13.15

â€¢ US Durable goods orders 13:30

â€¢ US New home sales 15:00

â€¢ European summit begins in Brussels 16:15;

working dinner at 18.15 followed by press conference

All times are UK local.

7.50am:

Welcome back to the live blog.

We'll bring you the latest news and commentary in the run-up to the crucial European leaders summit, which starts late afternoon in Brussels.

It's crunch time for the eurozone - yesterday's sudden decision to cancel the finance ministers' meeting set investors' nerves jangling, and Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's wobbly government is adding to the uncertainty.

European stock futures point to a lower open.

Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:

Agreement is expected on measures to leverage the EFSF to â‚¬1trn, subject to a successful vote this afternoon in the German Bundestag.

This could prove politically divisive though leaving Angela Merkel weakened if she has to rely on opposition votes to get the measure through.

The main concern remains on the extent of the new public sector involvement for voluntary Greek haircuts with numbers between 40% and 60% being bandied about.

This could remain a sticking point with banks reluctant to take more than a 40% hit while the IMF, and EU leaders insistent on a much bigger haircut.

This impasse could well delay the second Greek bailout, and we may well find that some parts of any agreement could get kicked down to G20 at Cannes next week.

On top of this, Italy's government could be on the verge of collapse with Berlusconi, under huge pressure to finally deliver on spending reforms from fellow EU leaders, struggling to get support from within his own government for such measures.

Later this morning Italy is set to publish its latest business confidence figures for October . Italy is also expected to sell â‚¬10bn of short-term debt and 2013 bonds, and given the recent rise in yields, could well end up paying much more to get them away, said Hewson.

In the UK, the latest CBI industrial orders data for October is expected to show only a marginal improvement from -9 to -7, reinforcing concerns about UK industry.

Later in the US we get durable goods orders for September, which are set to slip further, while new home sales are expected to bump along the bottom.

crisis rumbles on as EU leaders produce half-finished deal

The eurozone crisis is far from over as EU leaders continue to try to thrash out a plan.

EU leaders are anxiously awaiting the verdict of the financial markets after the latest attempt to solve the euro crisis reached deadlock.

Crucial talks with private creditors over the losses they would take on Greek government bonds ran into a roadblock after a second euro summit in four days had earlier endorsed plans to recapitalise Europe 's weaker banks by â‚¬106.5bn, with Germany said to be raising the threat of a disorderly default.

Bankers, according to sources, believe the EU as a whole dare not take this "nuclear option".

Proposals to increase the â‚¬440bn bailout fund's firepower "several fold" or closer to â‚¬1trn according to a draft statement, were also put on hold.

The man leading the Greek "haircut" talks on behalf of the banks and insurance companies, Charles Dellara of the Institute for International Finance (IIF), said there was "no agreement on any element of a deal," raising the threat of a default by Greece.

The banks have offered to accept writedowns of 40% but the EU, led by German chancellor Angela Merkel , insists on at least 50% â€“ and perhaps up to 60%.

Dellara and bankers later went into emergency talks with Merkel, French president Nicolas Sarkozy, and IMF managing director Christine Lagarde in the private office of European Council president Herman Van Rompuy.

Merkel and Sarkozy, EU sources said, were commuting back and forth between the full summit and the office where they were holding the talks with bankers, in a desperate attempt to save the summit.

Europe's financial markets were closed by the time the first of a number of official statements emerged from the talks, but on Wall Street the immediate response was one of relief, with the Dow Jones closing up 162 points, or 1.4%.

The day of make-or-break talks began with drama in the Italian parliament, where one of Silvio Berlusconi 's closest allies was involved in a fist fight.

Meanwhile, Merkel had pleaded with the Bundestag to allow her to leverage up the size of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to provide a bulwark against possible speculative attacks on Italy and Spain.

"This is a medium-sized bazooka," British sources said, as eurozone leaders admitted they would have to increase its firepower to more than â‚¬1tn if the markets were to be pacified.

"But please try harder."

EU sources have repeatedly said the â‚¬440bn fund could be "leveraged up" fivefold.

The outcome was far from the comprehensive rescue deal that some in the markets had been demanding, and investors will now be seeking more clarity about exactly how much capital will be pumped into Europe's banking sector.

Last night the pan-European regulator the European Banking Authority (EBA) revealed that around 70 bigger banks across Europe would face not only raising extra capital, but extra steps to restart the "term unsecured funding market".

This was required "to help banks to continue their lending activities in 2012 and to avoid a spiral of forced deleveraging and the ensuing credit crunches, which would affect the real economy," the EBA said.

Markets, likely to be unsettled by the lack of comprehensive decisions at the summit, may be further spooked by the EBA's admission that the final total for the recapitalisation fund might not be known until later in November.

Banks will be frustrated by the assertion that they must withhold bonuses and dividends until they have enough capital.

As expected, the UK's banks are not deemed to need any extra capital buffer.

But for Greek banks the sum is â‚¬30bn and for Spain it is â‚¬26bn â€“ a bigger number than perhaps expected.

Italian banks need â‚¬14bn, French banks â‚¬8.8bn and Germany's around â‚¬5bn .

Some of the world's biggest banks are fiercely resisting attempts to write down Greece's debt by 60%, with expectation mounting of a compromise that would leave the country's private sector creditors with losses of 50%.

Italy, seen as the biggest threat to the eurozone stability, faces intense pressure to produce a credible plan to reduce its debt, which is 120% of national output.

Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the Eurogroup, said:

"Our Italian friends know well that we have to assume that we will be informed this evening that there will be significant, structural [budget] consolidation efforts from Italy.

That is a must".

The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the markets would not be content with "mediocre compromises", adding:

"We need today to talk about Greece and ensure that Greek debt is sustainable and that we're finally finished with this business.

We must talk about the banks and how they get through this difficult phase  â€¦ We must ensure that this bazooka, the European rescue fund, is strong enough to show the market that we mean it. We also have to make sure this can't happen in the future.

We need strong supervision and live up to our promises."

The plan to recapitalise the banks hinges on increasing the EFSF and success in ending the 18-month struggle to resolve the problems of Greece â€“ where debt has ballooned to â‚¬360bn, requiring annual interest payments of 10% of national output.

Merkel said Greek debt should be cut to 120% of GDP by 2020, effectively meaning a 50% write down on bond holdings.

Tense negotiations between EU officials and the banks centre on the EU's demands that private creditors accept Greek debt is turned into new loans, with half written off, 15% returned as cash and 35% converted into long-term loans.

Merkel is holding out for as tough a settlement as possible, and has stuck to her demand that the ECB play no role in guaranteeing the bailout fund's increased firepower.

David Cameron, however, told EU leaders the ECB may eventually have to take on a key role.

"In the end it comes down to this.

Can the eurozone create enough of a firewall?"

UK sources said.

"Ultimately the ECB can stand behind the euro and say:

we have as many euros as it will take to defend the single currency."

Cameron said as he left:

"Well, we made some good progress tonight.

It's very much in Britain's interests that we sort out these problems and solve this crisis.

We have made good progress on the bank recapitalisation;

that wasn't watered down, it has now been agreed.

It will only go ahead when the other parts of a full package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight."

The draft eurozone statement makes plain the revamped EFSF will combine two elements:

insuring the first losses on issues of new debt, and setting up a series of "special purpose investment vehicles" using capital from sovereign wealth funds in, say, Asia, IMF loans and other sources.

The EFSF would again guarantee the first-loss part of these but German government sources indicated that there was no agreement on whether this should be 20% or 30%.

EU leaders eye 1 trillion euro bailout fund

From:

What are these?

EUROZONE leaders mulled boosting a bailout fund to one trillion euros ($A1.34 trillion) to contain the debt crisis as the leaders of Germany and France scrambled to convince banks to lose big on Greek bonds.

The 10-digit figure is expected to appear in the final declaration the eurozone's 17 leaders are to adopt at the close of a marathon summit that began today and was running well past midnight local time, a diplomat said.

Boosting the bailout fund is a key element in the crisis response eurozone leaders have promised, along with making banks agree to write down billions in Greek debt and recapitalising the banking sector so it can absorb the hit.

Under the plan, the eurozone would use clever financial footwork to "leverage" up the 440-billion-euro European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) without increasing guarantees provided by governments.

The bailout fund, the main weapon against the crisis, has already flown to the rescue of Portugal and Ireland, and would be tapped in a new Greek bailout.

But it would be too small to rescue bigger endangered economies, such as Italy and Spain.

"We are heading towards the one trillion euro ($1.39 trillion) figure," another diplomat said.

With negotiations deadlocked on a bid to get banks to share the pain on Greek debt, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and IMF chief Christine Lagarde met with the head of the banking lobby on the sidelines of the summit, according to diplomatic sources.

While governments want the banks to accept a 50-percent "haircut," the lenders are offering 40 percent as part of efforts to cut Greece's 350 billion euro debt mountain.

"We remain open to a dialogue in search of a voluntary agreement.

There is no agreement on any element of a deal," said Charles Dallara, head of bank lobby, the Institute of International Finance.

With fears growing that the eurozone debt drama will turn into a banking system meltdown, European leaders struck a deal to force banks to raise their capital buffers at a summit of the 27-nation EU, which preceded the eurozone talks.

"We made good progress on the bank recapitalisation, that wasn't watered down, it now has been agreed," said British Prime Minister David Cameron.

Mr Cameron added that the deal "will only go ahead when the other parts of the full package go ahead, and further progress on that needs to happen tonight."

The European Banking Authority said banks would need 106 billion euros to fulfill the requirements.

The gathering of EU leaders was their second summit in three days as markets and world leaders called on them to produce the watertight deal needed to defuse fears the crisis will trigger global recession.

"Everyone is impatiently awaiting the details but it's not the devil that's in the details, it's all of hell," said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

"Will we know the details tonight?

I'm prudent, not to say sceptical."

After Greece, Ireland and Portugal were bailed out in the past year, EU leaders put pressure on embattled Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi to bring proof of his resolve to prevent his country from drowning in debt.

Mr Tusk said Mr Berlusconi had made a "good impression" at the EU summit with a letter outlining plans to tackle EU concerns over Rome's giant debts by November 15.

But it remained to be seen whether he convinced his 16 eurozone peers.

Europe has demanded that Italy slash its 1.9-trillion-euro debt pile, equal to 120 percent of GDP, and also enact structural reforms -- including raising its retirement age.

A bigger EFSF could help to ease pressure on Italy, but leaders needed to agree on ways to boost its firepower.

With the world on tenterhooks, emerging powers China and Russia waded in with offers to help Europe safeguard the global economy by contributing to the eurozone rescue fund.

The development came as global powers, from the United States to Japan and China, pressed European leaders to come up with a lasting solution to the debt crisis before a G20 summit in France on November 3 and 4.

Europe's leaders are examining two options to boost the EFSF without increasing guarantees from member states as taxpayers in countries such as Germany are fed up with pouring money down what they see as a bottomless hole.

The EFSF's firepower could be multiplied around fourfold by agreeing that the bailout fund could guarantee around 20 percent of debt issued by fragile states such as Italy and Spain.

A second fund, which would likely be linked to the EFSF, would also be created to attract private and public investors, including countries outside the eurozone such as China and Russia.

The second fund could also be linked to the International Monetary Fund, an idea Russia has said it prefers.

EU strikes deal to ease debt crisis

Bailout boost for Europe-sources

European leaders agreed to boost the region's bailout fund to one trillion euros, but details still have to be decided.

At the same time, a framework for re-funding banks was agreed upon, according to EU sources.

UPDATE 5.14pm:

EUROZONE leaders have agreed to leverage the firepower of their bailout fund to one trillion euros ($A1.34 trillion), French President Nicolas Sarkozy says.

He announced the agreement today at the close of almost 10 hours of summit talks aimed at hammering out a package of measures to contain Europe's two-year debt crisis.

Under the agreement, the Eurozone's main bailout fund has been  boosted, private banks holding Greek debt will accept a 50 per cent loss  and banks must raise more capital so they are protected from any losses  stemming from government defaults.

At an emergency summit in Brussels, European leaders had already agreed to force banks to raise 106 billion euros ($A142.33 billion) by June - partially to ensure they could weather the expected losses on Greek debt.

They also neared agreement on boosting the firepower of the continent's bailout fund in order to prevent larger economies from finding themselves in need of a rescue like Greece's.

End of sidebar.

Return to start of sidebar.

The leaders are under immense pressure to finalise their plan after multiple delays and half-baked solutions.

Market confidence was waning and fears were growing that the two-year-old crisis could push Europe and much of the developed world back into recession.

But the third prong of their plan - finding a way to reduce Greece's crushing debts, which are on track to top 180 per cent of economic output - had been proving difficult.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel told MPs in Berlin that the goal was to bring Greece's debt down to 120 per cent of economic output by 2020.

There were concerns that that would require losses that the banks weren't willing to take on voluntarily.

Having a voluntary deal is important because imposing losses on banks can trigger massive bond insurance payments that risk creating huge turmoil on global financial markets.

A European official said early today a voluntary deal had been reached.

Another official confirmed that the banks agreed to take losses of 50 per cent of their Greek bonds.

According to

Greece's debt inspectors that would take the country's debt to just above 120 per cent by 2020.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending an official statement.

A spokesman for the organisation that has negotiated on behalf of the banks said he would release a statement soon, without confirming the deal.

Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper says the three-pronged agreement by Eurozone leaders to deal with the region's colossal debt crisis provides grounds for "cautious optimism".

Addressing the Commonwealth Business Forum in his first visit to Perth today, Mr Harper said the agreement represented actual progress after a frustrating, protracted wait.

"I am encouraged," Mr Harper told delegates.

"These are steps in the right direction."

Once again, as they have already done countless times before since the emergence of the European sovereign debt crisis, the 27 political head honchos of the European Union have boasted that they have saved the global economy from collapse with finally, the real definitive cure for the crisis.

However, the only thing really distinct with this latest version of the EU cure is that the numbers are much larger.

The politicos claim that they have received agreement from impacted banks to  write off 50 percent of the value of outstanding loans to Greece.

Banks in turn will receive recapitalization from the EU. And perhaps most striking in terms of attempting to win investor confidence, the value of the EFSF, or Eurozone bailout fund, will expand from just over $400 billion to around $1.4 trillion.

No wonder the European politicians are patting themselves on the back, while predictably stock exchanges across the globe are rallying to new, dizzying heights.

So, should we believe that this time, after so many failed attempts also advertised as the real solution,  the politicians have finally got it right?

I don't think so.

The massive write-down of Greek debt will jeopardize the financial solvency of many European banks, requiring massive recapitalization.

That is supposedly why the European Financial Stability Facility is being expanded to a level of one trillion euros.

But where will the Europeans get this money?

From the same banks they will need to bail out?

From investors already spooked by a 50 percent write-down on Greek debt?

From China?

From already over-leveraged German taxpayers?

In the meantime, the other PIIGS nations are on the brink of insolvency (Portugal, Italy, Ireland and Spain), not to mention fragile eastern European economies, which nobody in the EU will even discuss.

No wonder the agreement announced in  Brussels is lacking in specific details.

Nouriel Roubini tweeted this morning, "Little in EZ plan to restore growth/competitiveness.

Without it financial schemes (greek haircut, bank recap, levered EFSF) alone will fail."

Professor Roubini has had a far more reliable track record in predicting the trajectory of the global economic crisis then all the 27 EU political leaders and their army of economic and financial advisors combined.

The fact that Nouriel Roubini is already predicting that the EU's latest bailout plan will fail is far more significant, in my view, then all the stock market rallies being fed by the latest self-congratulatory propaganda coming out of Brussels.

 

Greek Rescue Deal:

Bondholders Take 50% Loss

The Sweeney Todd of financial haircuts.

by  John Hayward

Comments

European leaders hammered out the details of their rescue plan for Greece this morning, to the relief of markets fearful of a total implosion.  The European Union deal prevents that, or at least forestalls it, but some bondholders are probably feeling rather imploded right about now, as the Associated Press reports the deal involves handing them a 50% loss on Greek bonds:

After a marathon summit, EU President Herman Van Rompuy said that the deal will reduce Greece's debt to 120 percent of its GDP in 2020.

Under current conditions, it would have grown to 180 percent.

That will require banks to take on 50 percent losses on their Greek bond holdings -- a hard-fought deal that negotiators will now have to sell to individual bondholders.

Van Rompuy also said the eurozone and International Monetary Fund -- which have both been propping the country up with loans since May of 2010 -- will give the country another euro100 billion ($140 billion).

That's slightly less than amount agreed in July, presumably because the banks will now pick up more of the slack.

So holding Greek government debt down to 120% of GDP is a great achievement, and all it took was getting the folks who financed that reckless government spending for years to swallow a 50% loss in value on their holdings.  That’s the kind of financial “haircut” that ends with a slide down to Mrs. Lovett’s meat pie shop.

Greece is a very advanced example of fiscal disease that the rest of the developed world should not flatter itself into thinking it’s immune to.  Insane spending levels turned Greece into an insolvent disaster… and when the day came that even the merest pretense of a functioning government was impossible, they turned to the larger financial entity their economy was connected to, the European Union.  The EU couldn’t afford to let Greece detonate, for a variety of reasons (not least of which are the shaky situations in Spain and Italy) so some kind of bailout was inevitable. 

It’s a story that will be repeated, with various permutations, in state and local governments throughout America during the years ahead.  It’s always crazy to talk about even the most reasonable fiscal restraint until doomsday arrives, at which point the rest of the country will be presented with irresistible bailout demands.  Today, Governor Kasich’s collective bargaining reforms are in trouble on Ohio ballot initiatives;

tomorrow, when Ohio implodes from lunatic union demands, every national officeholder will be told they have no choice but to bail it out.  The notion of allowing Ohio to suffer the consequences from its earlier irresponsibility will be dismissed out of hand as unthinkable.  You’ll hear modified versions of the same arguments tossed around the European Union with respect to Greece for the last few years.

Obviously, banks and investors who have been buying Greek bonds for years never expected they’d be asked to swallow a 50% loss.

 There might have been few other good options on the table… but responsible government involves the restraint and foresight to avoid sitting at that sort of table.  This is delayed-action wealth redistribution on a massive scale.  Government bonds are supposed to be stable investments, although certainly latter-day investors in Greece knew they were taking some pretty big chances.  Today’s rescue package makes swindlers of the Greek government.

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso declared, “These are exceptional measures for exceptional times.

Europe must never find itself in this situation again.”  What makes him think it won’t?  Greece has been rocked by a general strike and violent riots to protest austerity measures, including pension cuts and tax increases.  They were tossing firebombs outside of Parliament last week, and somebody got killed.  The enduring tragedy of Greece will unfold through a populace ruined by decades of socialism, which views debt at 120% of GDP as unbearable austerity.

It finally looks like the European Union is on the right track.

After  almost two years of vacillating, finger pointing and empty promises, the  outlines of a deal were announced this week in Brussels that could  provide a solution to Europe’s debt crisis.

The EU gave itself a self-imposed deadline of this Wednesday to come up  with at least an outline of a deal.

It wasn't easy.

There were so many  moving parts to include that in the end it took a marathon, ten-hour  series of negotiations to get everyone on board.

The respective finance ministers addressed the three areas that most  threatened the financial well-being of the Union.

Greek debt was the  first order of business.

Europe's leaders vowed to reduce that nation's  debt to 120 percent of GDP versus its present rate of 180 percent.

Much  of this reduction will be accomplished by asking private creditors  (mostly banks) to accept a 50 percent loss on the Greek bonds they hold.

It remains to be seen whether these financial institutions will  cooperate, but governments have historically managed to get what they  have wanted from the private sector (or else).

This 50 percent "haircut" is equal to roughly $139 billion, which will  be applied to a second rescue plan for Greece.

The Euro leaders promised  to guarantee the remaining half of Greece's existing debt and will  spend as much as $42 billion to insure against further losses.

It will  take at least another two or three months to finalize this debt deal.

The next issue, of course, was how to mitigate the big hit Europe's  banks are going to take in this haircut.

The losses they will incur will  drastically lower their reserves and the major concern was how to  replenish these reserves quickly.

The banks have been directed to go out  into the open market and raise as much as $148 billion between now and  next June.

Of course, the devil is in the details.

There is no guarantee that there  will be an appetite for new European debt or equity offerings.

Still,  depending on the terms, there may be demand from countries such as  China, Brazil or in the worst case, European governments themselves that  may be buyers of last resort if push comes to shove.

The EU recently agreed to establish a European Financial Stability  Facility and fund it with $610 billion.

Somewhat akin to the U.S. TARP,  the ESFS is a bailout mechanism, only instead of baling out banks, the  money was earmarked to save countries like Italy, Portugal and Greece.

The problem was the EFSF is just too small to insure the debt of bigger  countries.

There was a need to leverage the fund in order to insure at  least part of the debt of borderline economies like Italy and Spain.

The  ministers agreed to allow the ESFS to act as a direct insurer of bond  issues, which will bring the total firepower of the fund up to $1.39  trillion.

This should make new bond offerings by Italy and Spain more  attractive to investors, according to the EU.

There is also an effort to entice big institutional investors from both  the private sector as well as government sovereign funds to contribute  to a special fund, backed by the EFSF, which could be used to buy  government bonds as well as to help in the recapitalization of Europe's  banks.

I admit there are still a lot of details to work out but the Europeans  should get an "A" for effort in finally addressing the core problems of  their financial crisis.

I do believe that implementing this program will  take time.

The process will be less than perfect and that could mean  more disappointment ahead, but at least Europe is on the right track at  last.

Merkel has asserted that Germany’s future prosperity depends greatly on strong Eurozone partners.

There are also ominous worries that Greece’s debt crisis may spread to the much larger economies of Italy and Spain (two Mediterranean nations saddled with huge debt and weak economies).

A potential bailout of Rome and Madrid would likely greatly exceed the hundred-billion-plus in euros already allotted to Greece.

Robert Peston, business editor at BBC, wrote:

“There will be no stability for the Eurozone without the bailout fund having the resources to do its vital job of demonstrating to the world that there's no possibility of Italy or Spain going bust.”

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi – who reportedly resents ultimatums made upon his government by Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy - is preparing to present plans of his economic reforms to colleagues in Brussels.

Still, some points apparently have unanimous support – for example, there is widespread agreement that banks in Europe must be recapitalized.

It is believed that the big banks need to raise more than 100 billion euros ($139 billion) to defend against possible losses incurred by their exposure to Greece, Italy and Spain and other indebted euro zone nations.

The EFSF – currently holding 440 billion euros ($612 billion) must be expanded – although how this would be managed is not yet clear.

Also, lenders to Greece will be asked to take deeper losses – perhaps as much as 60 percent.

Nigel Cassidy, a BBC correspondent, commented:

“We may finally discover how much firepower has been amassed to try to blast away the debt turmoil steadily spreading from Europe's financially wayward periphery to its core.

Few expect the final package reached at Brussels will quite be the "big bazooka" demanded by UK Prime Minister David Cameron.

Yet the nature of the deal that's finally agreed will show whether the partners -- and Germany in particular -- have the will and capability to hold the currency zone together.

We are about to witness what may go down in history as one of the most significant meetings in EU history.”

The stakes are indeed extremely high.

Francois Fallon, the French Prime Minister, told reporters that if the EU failed to find a solution, "this could tip the European continent into unknown territory".

Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron told UK media:

“We made good progress tonight.

It is very much in Britain's interest that we sort out these problems and solve this crisis [...] We made good progress on the bank recapitalization.

That wasn't watered down, it has now been agreed.

It will only go ahead when the other parts of a full package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight.”

Despite some initial hopeful signs, pessimism seems to reign supreme in Brussels.

Sharon Bowles, Member of the European Parliament who also sits on Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, told reporters: :There will be no silver bullet solution but three things on the forefront of everyone's mind at the moment are:

enhancing the EFSF rescue fund, solving Greece, and recapitalizing our banks.”

She added: :”Expanding the EFSF rescue fund is the biggest bit of this real time experiment and we don't know where it will lead - perhaps China , perhaps the ECB. On Greece, a write-down of their debt seems inevitable but the stigma attached to it means Portugal and Ireland will not want to follow.

Recapitalising banks comes just in the nick of time.

Hopefully, finding solutions to these three items tonight will buy Europe the breathing space to get a bit of stability in the markets and inspire growth which is sorely lacking in this whole conundrum.”

The EU is expected to discuss its solutions to the debt crisis in a press conference early Wednesday evening.

In the meantime, Rompuy has also issued a statement.

He said:

“The consensus concerns both the banks' short-term and longer-term needs.

The overarching goal of the exercise is to foster confidence in the European banking sector.

Improved access of the banks' medium- and long-term funding is essential to avoid a credit crunch and to safeguard the flow of credit to the real economy.

States will provide guarantees enabling banks to raise term funds.

We decided to rely on a truly coordinated approach at EU level regarding the conditions and criteria.”

Take Ireland as a  counterpoint:

they're undergoing a true, painful, and arduous austerity  program, and as a reward, they still have to pay back their bondholders  at par and are receiving only a fraction of the EFSF bailout funds that  are being offered to Greece.

It's no wonder that, in the wake of today's  news, Ireland has called for another round of EU subsidies and  permission to impose haircuts on its bondholders.

German Chancellor Merkel  stated that the goal of the latest accord is to help Greece achieve a  debt-to- GDP ratio of 120% by 2020.

In essence, they're trying to take  the patient from death's door back to a coma.

Does this really solve the  problem?

Who is going to lend to Greece now, in the wake of a 50%  haircut and with a target debt-to- GDP that would make most  countries blush?

None of the underlying spending problems have been  resolved by this deal, and Greece is still by any measure a basket-case.

Of course, the euro is  rallying on this news, with investors grateful that some discipline was  imposed and a total Greek collapse was put off to another day. But this  can't possibly be celebrated as a successful solution.

Italy's  debt-to-GDP is not far behind Greece, at 119%.

If the same solution were  to be offered when Italy faces default, the EU itself estimates that  the required bailout would have to be 28 times larger than what is being  offered to Greece today.

While Northern European taxpayers may be  bearing the brunt of today's $100 billion bailout, they can ill afford  $2.8 trillion.

Instead, the responsibility would fall on the ECB to  print the funds, and thereby devalue the euro.

Fortunately for Europe,  the US is well ahead of them on the quantitative easing front.

That is  why some of the euro rally we're seeing may be deserved.

The euro has  taken a pounding relative to the US dollar because of the prevailing  sentiment that its problems are worse than America's;

however, no one  would ever expect the US government to allow state and municipal  creditors to pay 50¢ on the dollar.

No, the US government's position has  been that it will be the lender of last resort to all large market  actors, and it will make them whole.

The US has already bled its  taxpayers dry and resorted to furious money-printing to forestall a  Treasury rate spike.

Europe's fractured political landscape is actually  providing a check on its profligacy that the politically consolidated  United States doesn't have.

Still, it should be  clear to all observers now that the Keynesian prescription has not  worked, and therefore both continental federations are facing a grim  future.

It may be that this Greek settlement marks the dawn of a new era  of sovereign collapse.

Today, for the first time since World War II, a  first-world country has outright defaulted on its general debt.

Mainstream analysts had said that a day like this would never come.

And  yet, here we are.

In a best-case scenario,  Western governments increasingly accept that creative destruction is a  part of capitalism - that bad debts must be liquidated fully, honestly,  and quickly to make room for new growth.

In the more-likely scenario,  the EU's structural divide keeps it walking a middle road between  bailouts and default of its weaker members, while the US refuses to  accept reality until it risks becoming the largest sovereign collapse in  history.

Let's hope laissez-faire prevails, but invest like we know  better.

The European Union has staved off disaster for the time being.

October 27, 2011-  Leaders in Europe came to an agreement in helping Greece and to fight the continuing debt crisis in the region.

The EU leaders agreed that bondholders would have to accept 50% losses on the Greek debt they are holding.

The leaders also said they would increase the rescue funds to $1.4 trillion.

Leaders of the EU have been under pressure from world leaders to come up with a plan to fight the financial crisis that is gripping the region and the world.

After two crisis summits in less than four days, the leaders delivered their plan they hope will take them out of the debt crisis.

Leaders were hoping the write down of Greece debt would quarantine the country as well as hoping the new plan will prevent any further negative speculation about France and Italy.

They feared further negativity about the region would ravage the euro zone and cause havoc with the global economy.

Angela Merkel, German Chancellor said, “The eyes of the world were on our meetings.” Adding, “The correct decisions were reached tonight for the regional and world economies.”

Decisions agreed to in the talks include European banks being recapitalized, the International Monetary Fund possibly taking on a bigger role, Italy committing to reduce its debt and the European Central Bank maintaining its posture of secondary market bond purchases.

On the announcement of the agreement, stocks advanced and the euro was higher.

But some prominent private sector investors said that significantly more detail was needed before policymakers could legitimately call a turning point in the emergency.

Mohamed El-Erian, the CEO of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund, said:

"How will the EFSF be leveraged?

Where will money for the capital [for banks] come from?

What will taxpayers be required to pay?"

The agreement on the 50 per cent write-down of Greek debt was struck between the eurozone and the global banking umbrella group, the Institute for International Finance (the IIF), after a decisive intervention from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and the head of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde.

But the IIF confirmed yesterday that it does not speak for all the holders of Greek bonds, which means that some investors might refuse to take part in the "voluntary" write-down and could yet unravel the deal.

There was only a vague outline of how the strength of the European bailout fund will be enhanced.

The official summit statement said that this would be done by offering investors insurance to hold new bonds by troubled eurozone members and "with a combination of resources from private and public financial institutions and investors, which can be arranged through Special Purpose Vehicles".

This is believed to refer to a proposal to tap funds from Chinese sovereign wealth funds.

Mr Sarkozy telephoned his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, yesterday to sell the plan.

The French President's office released a statement saying that Mr Hu "agreed to co-operate closely to ensure the G20 can make a decisive contribution to ensure growth and global stability."

This approach will be followed up today when Klaus Regling, the chief executive officer of the EFSF, travels to China.

Another area where the summit text is unclear is over the role of the International Monetary Fund in relation to the new powers of the bailout fund.

The final summit statement announced that "further enhancement of the EFSF resources can be achieved by cooperating even more closely with the IMF."

But British Government officials said they would not be prepared to countenance the IMF putting in any significant new money into the eurozone.

They admitted that the IMF might need to be recapitalised due to the demands of the global financial crisis, but insisted this should not be to help the eurozone alone.

Speaking in the House of Commons after the Brussels agreement, the Chancellor, George Osborne told the Commons:

"Supporting countries that cannot support themselves is what the IMF exists to do and there may well be a case for further increasing the resources of the IMF to keep pace with the size of the global economy."

But he added that he was, "only prepared to see an increase in the resources that the IMF makes available to all countries.

We would not be prepared to see IMF resources reserved only for use by the eurozone".

Euro rescue deal:

Will it work?

Greek debt relief

What was wanted

Before this meeting eurozone states, Germany in particular, faced having to pump money indefinitely into Greece to stop Athens defaulting and sparking a global financial panic.

That is why they demanded a drastic cut in Greece's €350bn debt burden.

The call was for the holders of Greek sovereign bonds to accept a "haircut" of at least 50 per cent on the value of their investments.

What we got

The lobby group representing the world's top banks, the Institute of International Finance (IIF), bowed to the pressure from European leaders in Brussels and said members will accept a 50 per cent haircut.

But when banks and other investors swap their existing Greek bonds for new ones, worth 50 per cent less, they will receive insurance on the new bonds underwritten by European states.

What next?

The statement from the eurozone summit says the write-downs should be agreed by the end of this year and that the exchange of Greek bonds should take place in early 2012.

The IIF cannot force haircuts on its members, and does not speak for all private-sector holders of Greek bonds, but the IIF expects most of its members to agree to the write-downs.

Recapitalisation of the banks

What was wanted

The capital markets demanded that the hole in the balance sheets of European banks, estimated by the International Monetary Fund at €200bn, be filled.

Investors were unwilling to lend to these banks while they feared there was a risk they might not get their money back.

Analysts were calling for the sector to raise, in total, between €100bn and €250bn in new capital, in order to reassure investors.

What we got

European leaders have told the Continent's banks to raise €106bn in new funds in order to raise their capital ratios to 9 per cent.

They must try to do this, first, by tapping private markets.

Then they must apply to their own governments.

And if they are unable to raise money in either of these ways, they will be allowed to apply to the European bailout fund, the EFSF.

What next?

The banks must outline how they plan to raise capital by the year's end to their national authorities.

They must raise the money by 30 June 2012.

Yet some banks have indicated they will try to reach their new capital ratios by reducing their lending.

Some say the €106bn figure is out of date and that they do not need to raise so much to meet the ratio.

Boosting the bailout fund

What was wanted

A "big bazooka" to convince markets that eurozone governments would support any member state in danger of crashing out of the euro.

One idea was to turn the existing European bailout fund, the €440bn EFSF, into a bank funded by the unlimited resources of the European Central Bank.

The new EFSF would support member states by buying their bonds and recapitalising their banks.

What we got

The insurance idea won out. But eurozone governments will also set up another fund, a Special Purpose Vehicle.

This will try to raise money from wealthy state investment funds in the developing world and lend to the EFSF so it can support member states.

This means that the €440bn in the EFSF could boost its firepower up to €1.5trn.

What next?

The eurozone said it will provide more details on this scheme next month.

Many questions remain about what guarantees would be offered to Asian investors for their funds, how much of the face value of the issuance of new bonds the EFSF would insure and what role the IMF will play in all this.

In numbers:

Greece's debt woes

165% Greek debt (as percentage of GDP).

152% Greek debt in 2020 without 50% haircut for bondholders.

120% Greek debt in 2020 with 50% haircut for bondholders.

80% UK debt now.

TARP Didn’t Cause a Rally — So Beware Market’s EU Optimism

Sweeping political solutions don't guarantee success

Oct 27, 2011, 3:33 pm EDT   |   By Jeff Reeves , Editor, InvestorPlace.com

     

Back in the 2008 financial crisis, the big risk was ugly mortgages on bank balance sheets and the kinky derivatives that became “financial weapons of mass destruction.” But that problem of bad debt alone wasn’t the reason for a market catastrophe and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.

Rather, it was the systemic risk caused a crisis of confidence and a resultant credit freeze.

“Crisis of confidence” pretty much sums up the last few weeks in Europe.

The difference this time is the losses are at governments, not banks, and the cause for the budget issues is decades of irresponsible spending instead of irresponsible lending.

But the bottom line for nations like Greece, Italy and Spain is the same — no more money to spend, and no willing lenders to help you pay your bills.

What’s the big difference this time?

Well, after Lehman went under, the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve pulled out all the stops to prevent a breakdown of the whole financial system.

On Oct. 3, 2008, President George W. Bush signed into a law a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program meant to offset debt troubles and get the credit markets functioning again.

The market responded by dropping 18% in the next five trading days.

It was down 27% six weeks after the announcement, and down 37% five months after TARP was revealed.

This time, we are seeing a strong rally surrounding the bailout news in Europe.

The broader market is up about 14% since Oct. 4, a mere three weeks’ time, and today’s surge in the Dow brought it to its highest levels since the go-go days of July before U.S. and euro zone debt issues seized Wall Street’s attention.

You have to wonder how long it will last.

True, the original Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 failed in late September that sparked the declines in 2008.

But again there are parallels with the early stumbling in the EU a few weeks ago that caused uncertainty.

And granted, the European situation is materially different than the bank bailout.

Euro zone governments propping up member states is much more palatable than Uncle Sam bailing out investment banks.

But read any of the commentary about the European Union bailout and you will see that there are very real concerns over the measure:

Here they are in a growing succession of alarm:

“Although the summit takes important steps towards addressing the large scale of the crisis confronting the euro area, the devil is in the details and the final form of the support is not going to be known until next month.” — Barclays Capital analysts

“Any deal was better than no deal on the night — but now critics are asking why China would want to bankroll European debt.” — London’s The Guardian newspaper in a blog headline

“The plans announced by euro-zone policy makers overnight look more like a pea shooter than the ‘bazooka’ previously promised to tackle the region’s problems.” — Jonathan Loynes , chief European economist at Capital Economics

“A malevolent mixture of monetary rigidity, uncontrollable debt and banking insolvency seems to doom any potential solution to irrelevance.” — a post in The Daily Bell blog run by The Foundation for the Advancement of Free-Market Thinking

 

Resolution hopes dwindle as leaders arrive for EU summit

Wednesday, October 26, 2011 - 04:36 PM

Hopes are fading that a plan to fix the eurozone debt crisis will emerge from today's emergency EU summit.

Europe's 27 leaders are meeting in Brussels this evening - for the second time in days - as efforts continue to reach an agreement.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is warning that there are still many problems to settle and negotiations to carry out.

The Chancellor says weaknesses in the euro must be addressed "now or never", and referred to the Eurozone challenge as the worst crisis for Europe since the end of World War II.

However draft conclusions leaked ahead of the talks show no deal on a figure for bank recapitalisation and diplomats are now warning that further meetings may be necessary later in the week.

Luxembourg premier Jean Claude Juncker is also downplaying the chances of any detailed rescue plan being finalised today.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny, who is attending the summit, said he wants major decisions made today but he warned that any such decisions should not mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty.

"I continue to believe that there is very considerable scope within the existing legal framework - however I'd be a fool... if I didn't say that there are others who take a different view" he said.

"(They) are strongly of the view that some change, however limited, is required.

"The case for this will have to be examined strongly over the coming months" he added.

British Prime Minister David Cameron - speaking on his arrival at the summit - said he wants to see a comprehensive solution.

"It is in British interests that we actually solve this crisis," Mr Cameron said.

"We need to have the greatest possible support for the most comprehensive solution possible."

But the real focus was on the powerhouse couple of Chancellor Merkel and French President Sarkozy, leading efforts to resolve their deep personal differences and steer the 17 eurozone members towards a deal which contains big enough figures to impress jittery markets that the EU is getting to grips with the problem of containing the Greek debt crisis and putting in place enough safeguards to cope with any future economic shocks.

Today was described last weekend as the day for final decisions – but even before the latest negotiating got under way officials in Brussels were dampening down expectations, insisting the talks were part of an ongoing process to resolve the crisis with a lasting set of measures.

Downing Street talking of a G20 summit in Cannes in early November as the real deadline, with more EU-level ministerial meetings on the cards in the next few days.

Ahead of the eurozone summit, the German parliament voted in favour of strengthening the EU’s bailout fund – a boost for Mrs Merkel and a lift for talks which seem to remain divided on crucial details of a three-point plan to crack the crisis.

A provisional agreement is already in place on the recapitalisation of Europe’s most exposed banks to the tune of about €100bn.

Many financial experts say at least half as much again will be needed to convince markets that they are well insulated against further economic shocks.

On the second plank, disputes over efforts to leverage an existing €440bn) bailout fund to boost its lending capacity above €1tn may have receded thanks to the German parliament vote, although a figure has not been finalised.

If it is agreed it should demonstrate determination to respond to any more Greek-style meltdowns.

And a decision is still awaited on a demand that private investors – mainly banks – absorb at least a 50% write-off of their loans to Greece.

A consortium of global banks has so far suggested 40%, but that has been rejected.

Meanwhile, the spectre of a debt-laden Italy was hanging over the talks, with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi facing demands to act on austerity measures in return for financial aid.

The fear is that a Greek-style crisis in Italy will be totally unaffordable for Europe, and make the scale of financial support for Athens look like pocket money.

 

EU meets resistance to increase in haircut | 25/10/2011

IRISH TIMES REPORTERS

Europe's leaders intend to multiply their rescue fund fourfold to €1 trillion and press Greece's creditors to accept losses of over 50 per cent on their bondholdings, but the details of their plan to end the debt crisis are still not fully formed.

A draft statement from an emergency euro zone summit today, obtained by Reuters, outlined two options to leverage the €440 billion fund designed to shore up heavily indebted states and thwart market attacks.

If the draft is adopted with little change, the second summit in four days will have sketched broad intentions but failed to produce a detailed master plan to scale up the fund, recapitalise banks and reduce Greek debt to a sustainable level.

"It's moving in the right direction but it is going to disappoint the market, particularly given the emphasis policy makers put on this meeting," said Jessica Hoversen, foreign exchange analyst at MF Global in New York.

One proposal involves creating a special purpose investment vehicle (SPIV) to tap foreign sovereign and private investors, such as Chinese and Middle Eastern wealth funds, to buy bonds of troubled euro zone countries.

The other method for scaling up the European Financial Stability Facility, which was set up last year, involves using it to offer partial guarantees to purchasers of new euro zone debt.

The two options could be used simultaneously and the International Monetary Fund could also help.

Euro zone finance ministers will be asked to finalise the terms and conditions in November, the statement said.

EU sources said the EFSF was expected to be leveraged by something like a factor of four giving it scope of around €1 trillion.

It has about €250 billion to €275 billion euros available given funds set aside for aid to Greece, Ireland and Portugal and for recapitalising the region's banks.

European leaders' pattern of responding too little, too late to a debt crisis that began in Greece has spawned a wider economic and political crisis that threatens to undermine the euro single currency and the European Union project.

A senior EU source said the euro zone leaders want private sector creditors to accept a writedown of more than 50 percent on their holdings of Greek government debt in order to reduce Greece's total outstanding private sector debt by around €100 billion.

While there is consensus on the need for European banks to raise around €110 billion in extra capital to withstand a potential Greek debt default, governments and banks are still haggling over the scale of write-offs.

In an effort to push through the deal, French president Nicolas Sarkozy and German chancellor Angela Merkel are prepared to meet with bankers on Wednesday night to negotiate face-to-face, the senior source said.

EU leaders agreed the outlines of a package on bank recapitalisation, including raising the core capital ratios of European banks to 9 per cent by the end of June 2012, but they did not provide a headline figure, which will depend in part on negotiations over Greece and its second bailout package.

"There will be give and take with the banks until the last minute," a Greek government source involved in the Brussels negotiations said.

Mr Sarkozy is also expected to talk with Chinese president Hu Jintao soon on Chinese participation in the EFSF bailout fund.

Mario Draghi, the incoming head of the European Central Bank threw the euro zone a lifeline hours before the summit, signalling the ECB would go on buying troubled states' bonds as leaders of the 17-nation single currency area struggled to agree a convincing set of measures.

"The Eurosystem (of central banks) is determined, with its non-conventional measures, to prevent malfunctioning in the money and financial markets creating an obstacle to monetary transmission," he said in typically coded ECB language in a speech text released in Rome.

Mr Draghi, who will succeed Jean-Claude Trichet next month, made clear that measures could only be a temporary expedient and said it was up to governments to tackle the roots of the debt crisis that began in Greece two years ago.

However, his statement appeared to rebuff pressure from Germany's powerful Bundesbank for the ECB to end the bond-buying programme which prompted the resignation of the two most senior German ECB policymakers this year.

It also appeared to supersede a dispute between Germany and France over how the ECB, the ultimate defender of the euro, should be involved in trying to resolve the crisis.

Ms Merkel won a parliamentary vote of support for strengthening the rescue fund after warning in a dramatic speech that Europe was facing its most difficult situation since the end of World War II.

"If the euro fails, then Europe fails," she declared, saying there was no certainty that the continent would then enjoy another 60 years of peace.

Ms Merkel told parliament that private bondholders would have to take a substantial write-down so that Greece's debt could be reduced to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from 160 per cent this year.

Experts said that implied a 50 per cent "haircut" for private investors.

Also weighing on the summit was deep concern about Italy, which is now in the bond market firing line.

Under huge pressure from its euro zone partners, Rome promised a package of reform steps to boost growth and control its public debt, including labour and pensions reforms and additional revenues from property divestments.

In a letter sent to the summit in Brussels, the government said it would produce a plan of action to boost growth by Nov. 15, promising to raise the retirement age to 67, cut red tape and modernise state administration to improve conditions for business and raise €5 billion a year from divestments and improved returns from state property.

Rome's inability to deliver a substantive plan for reforming its pensions system has raised doubts about prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's seriousness in tackling a crisis that threatens the euro zone's third largest economy.

Italy has the euro zone's largest sovereign bond market, with a public debt of €1.8 trillion, 120 per cent of GDP. If it went the same way as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the rescue fund would not have enough money to bail Rome out.

Full text of EU summit deal

IRISH TIMES REPORTERS

World stock markets rose in trading today after European Union leaders agreed a three-part deal early designed to stem the euro zone debt crisis.

The euro hit a seven-week high and stock markets 12-week highs after officials in Brussels said agreement had been reached with banks on a 50 per cent write-off of Greek debt and a mechanism to boost the euro zone’s main bailout fund to €1 trillion.

When coupled with an earlier decision to recapitalise vulnerable banks, the summit delivered on the package it promised.

Major European bourses all closed up significantly higher with the FTSE 100 in London up 2.8 per cent, the German Dax up 5.5 per cent and the French CAC 40 up 6.2 per cent.

The Iseq index of leading shares closed up 100.34 points to 2766.38.

Wall Street was also higher in early trading.

After the summit, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said after the deal Ireland would not be seeking a writedown on its bank debt and would instead seek to re-engineer it in a way that was less expensive.

Mr Noonan said the country's interests would not be served by imposing a haircut on bondholders.

Although Ireland is only mid-way through an unprecedented eight-year cycle of austerity, Mr Noonan said Greece, the first country to receive a bailout, would continue to be far worse off for some time to come.

"If you look at the Greek situation, if you look at the best case scenario... they are looking at another 10 years of austerity programmes.

At the most malign scenario they say the Greeks won't be out of trouble until 2027," he said.

Earlier today, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said the deal would not harm Irish interests.

He also said the proposed haircut for Greek bondholders was unique to that country, and there was still funding available for Ireland.

EU president Herman Van Rompuy said the deal would reduce Greece’s debt to 120 per cent of its GDP in 2020.

He added that the euro zone and International Monetary Fund would give Athens another €100 billion.

French president Nicolas Sarkozy said the agreement would “give a credible and ambitious and overall response to the Greek crisis”.

The text of summit conclusions refers to the bailout fund being leveraged “several fold” - leaving plenty of scope for jittery markets to question the value of its increased firepower in tackling existing and future economic problems in the single currency area.

The complexity of the deal meant talks between the 17 leaders euro zone leaders – holding their second summit in four days – continued until early this morning.

Key aspects of the deal, including the mechanics of how the EFSF will be boosted and providing Greek debt relief, could take weeks to finalise.

Three months ago, euro zone leaders unveiled another agreement designed to draw a line under the debt problem.

It became apparent within weeks that it was inadequate given the depth of Greece's economic problems and the vulnerability of their banks.

The new deal aims to address these problems.

Under it, the private sector has agreed to voluntarily accept a nominal 50 per cent cut in its bond investments to reduce Greece's debt burden by €100 billion, cutting its debts to 120 per cent of gross domestic product by 2020, from 160 per cent now.

The euro zone will offer "credit enhancements" or sweeteners to the private sector totalling €30 billion.

The aim is to complete negotiations on the package by the end of the year, so Greece has a full, second financial aid programme in place before 2012.

The value of that package, EU sources said, would be €130 billion - up from €109 billion in the July deal.

"The debt is absolutely sustainable now," Greek prime minister George Papandreou said after the deal was struck.

"Greece can settle its accounts from the past now, once and for all."

EU finance ministers are not expected to agree on the nitty-gritty elements of how the scaled up EFSF will work until some time in November, with the exact date not fixed.

There is also concern about Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's commitment to implementing reforms seen as crucial for restoring confidence in the bloc's third largest economy.

Japan and Canada welcomed the euro zone agreement.

China's official Xinhua news agency said the outcome was "positive but filled with difficulties".

Leaders gather for crunch EU talks

Wed Oct 26 2011 7:29

European leaders are gathering in Brussels to discuss urgent plans aimed at resolving the eurozone crisis.

Hopes that the talks would lead to a comprehensive deal to prop up struggling states and strengthen banks in the region took a dive, after a meeting for finance ministers to discuss the finer details was cancelled.

Officials have been working frantically behind the scenes to find common ground on three key issues.

A provisional agreement is already in place on the recapitalisation of Europe's most exposed banks - none in the UK - to the tune of about 100 billion euros (£87 billion).

Many financial experts say around a further 50 billion euros will be needed to convince markets that they are well insulated against further economic shocks.

Questions still surround the region's bailout fund that currently stands at around 440 billion euros (£383 billion), as estimates suggest a more suitable figure of one trillion euros in order to provide sufficient funds for any more Greek-style meltdowns.

And a decision is still awaited on a demand that private investors - mainly banks - absorb at least a 50 per cent write-off of their loans to Greece.

EU leaders set Wednesday as a deadline during their talks at the weekend, but the timetable has seemingly stretched as finance ministers will meet later this week.

UK officials have also suggested that a further summit of leaders could be required to finalise the package.

EU leaders seal rescue deal

Thu Oct 27 2011 11:42

Europe's leaders have reached agreement on a three-part deal to tackle the region's debt crisis.

Crunch talks in Brussels ended with an announcement on a new accord with banks, that will see them write-off 50 per cent of Greece's debt.

Officials also said that agreement had been reached on an extended bailout fund boosted by a complex "leveraging" system.

The ten hours of talks began with a meeting of all 27 heads of state - including Prime Minister David Cameron - but non-eurozone leaders departed after initial discussions.

The recapitalisation scheme does not involve UK banks but forces many European banks to increase their reserves by more than 100 billion euros.

French president Nicolas Sarkozy said the agreement would "give a credible and ambitious and overall response to the Greek crisis".

The EU had delivered "a comprehensive response to the sovereign debt crisis", European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said.

He said the summit deal restored confidence in the banking sector, with final conclusions making clear that "banks should be subject to constraints regarding the distribution of dividends and bonus payments".

Mr Barroso insisted:

"Increased responsibility and a fair contribution of the financial sector is central to our approach.

"These are exceptional measures for exceptional times.

"Europe must never again find itself in this situation.

"That is why we must further improve our economic governance, namely in the euro area:

the euro summit paves the way to a further strengthening of co-ordination and surveillance (of eurozone economies).

"The package we have agreed is a comprehensive package that confirms that Europe will do what it takes to safeguard financial stability."

STRATFOR:

The European financial crisis, Germany's proposal

2 days ago at 20:16     | STRATFOR

Editor’s Note:

STRATFOR, a geopolitical risk analysis company based in Austin, Texas, is a Kyiv Post partner.

Summary

Germany’s parliament voted Oct. 26 to limit the German commitment to European bailouts.

This move shows Germany’s unwillingness to continue serving as the primary source of funding for Europe as a whole.

This means circumstances within Europe must shift in order for the European Union and the eurozone to survive the current financial crisis.

Sharp writedowns of Greek debt would have to not trigger a financial meltdown, EU member states would have to put the union’s interests above their own, and outsiders would have to be persuaded to become the primary funders for the European bailout mechanism.

Analysis

STRATFOR has watched with great interest as the eurozone crisis has unfolded over the past 21 months.

In many ways this is the final stage of the post-Cold War interregnum.

In the aftermath of World War II, the European Union (and its predecessors) was created to both constrain Germany and harness Germany’s economic dynamism to bolster French power.

This was made possible because Europe was split and occupied by U.S. and Soviet forces, while Germany was denied the ability to unilaterally further its national interests.

Those circumstances have changed.

The Soviets left, the U.S. presence is a shadow of what it once was, and the Germans are reunified and once again looking out for themselves.

With the Cold War over, the European Union is left to its own devices.

Germany benefits greatly from the European Union and the eurozone.

These structures keep European competition firmly in the realm of economics and finance — areas in which the Germans, with their capital richness, central location, highly skilled labor and powerful industrial base, are well prepared to win. The European Union even created a regulatory structure that expressly puts German industry at an advantage.

But Germany is no longer willing to fund Europe, which it has done from immediately after World War II until very recently.

The Germans have “bailed out” Europe several times.

They paid massive war reparations — primarily to the French — after World War II. They funded the majority of the European Union’s development costs and agricultural subsidies for the first three decades of European integration.

They paid — by themselves — for the rehabilitation of the former East Germany and contributed the largest share of funding for the rehabilitation of the rest of the former Soviet satellites.

They also were forced to allow the other eurozone states to enter into the common currency at artificially depreciated currency exchange rates.

Dissatisfaction with this past role was apparent Oct. 26 when Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, voted overwhelmingly to approve Chancellor Angela Merkel’s negotiating position at the EU summit later that day.

The Bundestag capped Germany’s financial guarantee to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) — the eurozone’s bailout mechanism — at its current level of 211 billion euros ($294 billion).

(The EFSF does not contain actual state cash;

it uses government guarantees as backing to raise money on private bond markets.

Contributing states only have to fill their guarantees if states undergoing bailout procedures default, in which case investors will be reimbursed with state money.) The Germans believe they have done enough, and they will no longer serve as Europe’s cash machine.

The other important prohibitive clause in the legislation the Bundestag approved is opposition to the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) purchasing any state debt.

Such purchases are already illegal under EU treaties, but in order to prevent financial meltdowns the ECB has been making indirect purchases (it lends money to banks to buy the debt and, through economic machinations, ends up holding the debt).

The Germans see such actions not only as undermining a clause they fought very hard to get included in EU treaties, but also as directly undermining their efforts to get the weaker eurozone states to implement austerity measures.

Whether the ECB will follow the German recommendation — and it is a recommendation, as the ECB is officially independent — remains to be seen.

Mario Draghi, the Italian who will take over as ECB governor Nov. 1, has made it clear that he intends to maintain the purchase policy.

Discussions at the summit should be quite vigorous.

Between the prohibition on new government guarantees and the demand on ECB actions, the Germans have constrained — perhaps outright eliminated — the two largest and most credible sources of potential funding for the eurozone’s bailout systems.

Amid the financial crisis, Europeans see their banks' biggest problem as rooted in their sovereign debt exposure.

As a rule the largest purchaser of the debt of any particular European government will be banks located in the particular country.

However, much debt remains for outsiders to own, so when states crack, the damage will not be held internally.

Half or more of the debt of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Belgium is in foreign hands, but like everything else in Europe the exposure is not balanced evenly — and this time, it is Northern Europe, not Southern Europe, that is exposed.

When Europeans speak of the need to recapitalize their banks, creating firebreaks between cross-border sovereign debt exposure dominates their thoughts — which explains why the Europeans belatedly have seized upon the IMF’s original 200 billion-euro figure.

The Europeans are hoping that if they can strike a series of deals that restructure a percentage of the debt owed by the Continent’s most financially strapped states, they will be able to halt the sovereign debt crisis in its tracks.

This plan is flawed.

The figure, 200 billion euros, will not cover reasonable restructurings.

The 50 percent writedowns or “haircuts” for Greece under discussion as part of a revised Greek bailout would absorb more than half of that 200 billion euros.

A mere 8 percent haircut on Italian debt would absorb the remainder.

Moreover, Europe’s banking problems stretch far beyond sovereign debt.

Instead, the Germans are asking for much deeper private and non-European participation.

They want holders of Greek debt to take a much larger restructuring than the 21 percent discount agreed upon in July.

Leaks from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have echoed this, indicating that perhaps a 60-75 percent reduction in the bonds’ value is necessary if Greece is to ever recover.

In trade, the Germans are demanding that the current EU/IMF monitoring of Greece’s finances become permanent.

Somewhat surprisingly, there is no clear message on how the bailout fund will be expanded to handle more bailouts.

At its current size — 440 billion euros — it might be able to barely handle Spanish remediation, but a banking crisis or an Italian bailout would utterly overwhelm it.

In Merkel’s Bundestag speech Oct. 26, the chancellor indicated that some sort of financial leveraging option would be used, but that is something that will be debated and decided at the EU summit later in the day. Merkel will need to return to the Bundestag to get the specifics ratified.

With such limited financing options, the European bailouts are to be funded more or less by the kindness of strangers:

The EFSF’s existing funding limits are woefully inadequate for the tasks at hand, and if the Germans will not lead the way to increase its volume directly, eurozone governments are now wholly dependent upon outsiders to meet those funding commitments the eurozone governments refuse to. The Germans have stated very clearly what they expect from the rest of the European Union:

austerity. With no more German guarantees on order and with a leveraging plan that is somewhat dubious, the only means many EU states have of avoiding bankruptcy is to make extremely deep budget cuts.

These states are now in a bit of a race to implement austerity measures before the markets cut off funding.

To work, this strategy requires three very unlikely developments.

First, sharp writedowns of Greek debt must not start a general crisis.

The largest holders of Greek debt are the Greek banking sector and the Greek pension system, so sharp writedowns could save Athens on interest payments, but they will only increase the pension burden by causing a Greek banking meltdown that will require the Greeks — both state and private — to more aggressively tap the EFSF (which has not yet been expanded).

Even this assumes that the banks agree to a “voluntary” restructuring and do not simply declare Greece to be in default, which would trigger the cascade of financial failures the Europeans have spent the past two years trying to avoid.

Second, all of Europe’s financially troubled governments would have to put the European Union and the euro ahead of their own survival.

This is highly unlikely, but not (yet) impossible.

The Slovak government has already fallen over the EFSF issue, but it still approved ratification.

Additionally, in preparation for the Bundestag presentation and the subsequent summit, Merkel laid very heavily into one of Europe’s financial laggards:

Italy. Merkel’s actions triggered a political crisis in Rome, where pension reforms were agreed upon but at the cost of the promised resignation of political and financial fixture Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister.

Third, forces beyond Europe would have to buy in, en masse, to the European bailout, likely without guarantees that their funds are completely safe.

Under the pre-existing system any investors would be guaranteed to have 100 percent of their funds returned to them — courtesy largely of German taxpayers — should a weak state default.

Under any leverage plan, that recovery percentage would be smaller;

20 percent is emerging as the likely number for an absolute guarantee.

But the Europeans desperately need outsiders to buy in to provide the sort of bridge financing and financial safety nets required to keep Europe’s governments and banks afloat.

To that end, EFSF chair Klaus Regling is already planning trips to China and Japan — the world’s largest holders of foreign currency reserves — to try and convince them to use their stored cash for assistance.

Some purchases are likely, but if the Germans are unwilling to finance the rescue of a system they benefit from, it is difficult to envision others being willing to do more.

STRATFOR does not see any of these three scenarios as being particularly likely.

But without a great deal of financial commitment from Germany and the other, richer eurozone states, this is what must happen if the eurozone is to survive.

October 26, 2011, 10:34 p.m.

Reporting from London—

For those inclined to see the European Union as a hopeless contradiction in terms, the last year and a half has supplied more proof than they could possibly have imagined.

An endless series of emergency meetings, each supposedly the last, has generated little more than strategy pronouncements that are obsolete almost as soon as they're made.

Europe 's leaders have struggled to unite behind a convincing counterattack against a debt crisis that endangers not just the regional but the global economy.

Their lumbering approach was on display again Wednesday as officials argued into the night to formulate the latest "grand plan" to wrestle the crisis under control.

This time, EU leaders assured the world, they would unveil a solution that would finally — finally — fix the mess.

After marathon talks, they emerged early Thursday to announce that a new package of measures to rescue the euro currency had been agreed on. The deal entails increasing the firepower of Europe's bailout fund to about $1.4 trillion, getting holders of Greek debt to take losses of 50%, injecting Europe's biggest banks with about $150 billion to withstand those losses and providing Athens with an additional $140 billion to stay afloat.

"We have reached an agreement which I believe lets us give a credible and ambitious and overall response to the Greek crisis," French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters, adding that "the results will be a source of huge relief worldwide."

But that remains to be seen as markets weigh in with their response.

Though the new plan addresses the points considered most crucial, many analysts have contended that the bailout fund needs to be twice the size announced Thursday to be more than a temporary solution that merely buys Europe a bit more time.

Experts have also said Europe's banks may need double to triple the amount that officials agreed on in order to be on sound footing.

Still, the deal gives Europe a plan to tout at next week's key Group of 20 meeting in Cannes, France , where countries including China and the United States have been hoping to hear a report of major progress.

The goal of finding a comprehensive solution by the self-imposed Wednesday deadline was hampered by more of the squabbling that has bedeviled the EU since the start of the crisis.

In the last few days, Italy bristled at criticism of its finances by Germany , which clashed over boosting the bailout fund with France, which blasted unwelcome meddling from Britain.

And nobody wanted any lectures from outsiders, particularly the U.S., which had warned starkly that time was running out for Europe to get its act together.

"It's complete chaos," said Marc Touati, an analyst for French investment group Assya.

"It is no longer cooperative, or even effective."

What's worse, he added, "is that we're used to it."

The disarray became increasingly worrisome as the debt crisis edged from countries like Greece and Portugal on Europe's periphery closer to the continent's core, including the major economies of Spain and, more ominously, Italy, where financial markets have pushed up Italy's borrowing costs to close-to-unsustainable levels.

In the weeks leading up to Wednesday's summit, many analysts and investors were heartened by what seemed like recognition at last by the Eurozone of the gravity of the crisis and the need for a "shock and awe" strategy to beat it back.

Leaders themselves began speaking of the talks as a make-or-break moment.

But the dispute between Germany and France, the Eurozone's dominant duo, over how best to bolster the bailout fund and how much to cut Greece's debt forced officials to drop their original plan to unveil a solution after talks Sunday.

Then, on Wednesday, the new cutoff date, there was even more uncertainty.

Arriving in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel could tell reporters only that "everyone is traveling here today with the goal of getting a good way further."

At the same time, the government of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was on the verge of collapse over economic reforms demanded by fellow Eurozone nations.

A last-minute compromise with his coalition partners on pension reform and other issues allowed Berlusconi to show up for the summit with some promises in his pocket and his government weakened but intact.

It didn't help the cause of European unity that Merkel and Sarkozy were essentially seen to have ganged up on the Italian leader a few days earlier.

Even his fiercest domestic foes were outraged by a photo of Merkel and Sarkozy smirking knowingly at each other when asked at a news conference what they had said to Berlusconi during a private meeting.

"People are well aware that at the moment the EU is not functioning in an optimal way," said Daniela Schwarzer, an analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.

"And they're right."

As tensions heighten in Brussels we round up what has been said in the media so far today

Amidst fears of the Greek debt crisis spreading to Italy and Spain, EU leaders are finding it difficult to reach common ground on how to expand the EU’s bailout fund for debt-ridden countries.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on legislators to support measures to boost the fund.

Anti-bank demonstrators have gathered outside the Bundestag, unfurling a 15 metre-long banner calling for “die Banken in die Schranken” or “Cut the Banks down to Size“, with just a hint of “Stick the Bankers Behind Bars“.

Following are the reactions to today’s round of discussions:

BBC business editor Robert Peston:

“The EU is left with using complicated financial engineering that may only boost the EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility) capacity to about 1tn euros.

The markets may be disappointed in this move, which may only buy a year or so - not enough time for fundamental reform of Europe’s debt-ridden economies.

There was also disagreement over the extent of losses that should be imposed on Greece’s lenders, with Germany seeking a 50 per cent-60 per cent haircut.”

Channel 4, economics editor, Faisal Islam charted out the “broad contours of the crisis”:

“1. Bubble wrap the eurozone banks in €100bn more capital.

2. Get the banks to agree a write off of between 40 and 60 per cent of debts (vs 20 per cent already agreed)

3. Equip the Eurozone bailout facility with €1 trillion or two of firepower to deal with possible spill over for Spain and especially Italy.”

Former British chancellor Norman Lamont told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:

“There’s a very important aspect of this and that is something called credit default swaps - the insurance policies that are taken out to safeguard people, insure people, against default by sovereign authorities like Greece.

“One of the dangers of the haircut that is being proposed is that a severe haircut will cause a credit event and will trigger credit default swaps and will therefore affect banks who hold those credit default swaps.

“I personally think the long-term future of the euro will be argued about for some time to come because the strains there are so immense I don’t believe that the southern Mediterranean countries in the long run can ever really become fully competitive.”

M&G’s Stefan Isaacs commented on the eurozone mess – “time for inflation protection”:

“Travelling through Switzerland I can’t help but think that politicians both here and in the UK have a lot to thank their predecessors/electorates for. The relative safe-haven status enjoyed by both economies reflects, at least in part, the arm’s length relationship with the euro.

(Swiss readers may not take kindly to being compared with us Brits, but you take my point.)

“The eurozone policy makers who are currently trying to thrash out some sort of ‘deal’ have an almost impossible task on their hands.

Despite a belated recognition that some leadership is much required, the reality is that a comprehensive solution won’t be reached.

“We’ve talked before about the inherent dangers in any monetary union absent fiscal union.

Are the French, Italians, the Spanish, even the Greeks ready to be governed by Berlin?”

Mark Littlewood, Director General at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said:

“Two choices face the eurozone countries today – an orderly and painful widespread default or a chaotic and extremely painful bailout.

They should opt to bring this crisis to an end.

“It is time Europe’s leaders finally learnt to stop spending money they don’t have and those who have lent money to highly-indebted governments must now face the consequences.

“Using taxpayers’ money to save bank bondholders has got to stop.

Recapitalising banks using eurozone taxpayers’ money will simply lead more European governments to crisis point.

A structured default will be painful but it is infinitely preferable to the risky gamble that looks likely to be made today.

 “The assumption that lending to governments is safe no longer applies.”

Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital, said:

“Traders remain jittery and volumes stunted as the market waits for Europe’s leaders to finally put a lid on the debt crisis.

The recapitalization of European banks and a 50% haircut on Greek debt seems to be on the cards and could be just enough to ease investor concerns.

“But the market will also look for measures to ring-fence Italy and Spain from any contagion effect.

If deemed inadequate, we could see a return to the volatility of three months ago.”

Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC Partners:

“We were promised a master plan two weeks ago and yet here we are, even after extra meetings, expecting to be disappointed.

Its the Finance Ministers and their financial calculators that help give us the nitty gritty of any rescue plan and they are a no-show for today’s event.

“Meanwhile markets are adopting a “wait and see” approach, even though expectations are pretty low as to what will be achieved from today’s latest get together.

Grand, bold statements yes, and lots of talk of “saving the eurozone” and “solidarity” but in reality, if you ignore the PR managed quotes, what will actually have been achieved?”

FRANKFURT (MarketWatch) -- A joint statement by European Union leaders following a summit meeting in Brussels produced no figure for bank recapitalization requirements but said there was broad agreement on requiring a "significantly higher" 9% tier 1 capital ratio.

Polish Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski told reporters there would be no figure announced on the level of writedowns banks will take on Greek government debt.

News reports Wednesday said talks between European officials and banks were deadlocked over the issue of writedowns.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said EU leaders were near political agreement on a plan for addressing the euro-zone debt crisis.

A meeting of euro-zone leaders was set to get under way after the larger gathering of EU heads of state.

FRANKFURT (MarketWatch) -- Euro-zone leaders plan to leverage the region's 440 billion euro ($609 billion) bailout fund to give it 1 trillion euros in firepower, Reuters reported Wednesday.

The fund, known as the European Financial Stability Facility, has between 250 billion to 275 billion euros still available after bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

The plan is to leverage the fund by around four times through a special investment vehicle and a debt-insurance plan, the report said.

Euro-zone ministers are meeting Wednesday night in an effort to complete a wide-ranging plan to address the euro-zone's debt crisis.

News reports said French President Nicolas Sarkozy would call Chinese President Hu Jintao to urge China's participation in the investment vehicle.

By William L. Watts , MarketWatch

FRANKFURT (MarketWatch) â€” Europeâ€™s latest effort to contain the euro zoneâ€™s two-year-old debt crisis won applause from financial markets Thursday, but still falls short of a permanent solution, economists said.

The deal was hammered out in a marathon summit meeting in Brussels that stretched into the early hours of Thursday morning.

It includes a commitment by banks and other private bondholders to accept  a voluntary 50% writedown on Greek government debt, a boost in the lending power of the euro-zone bailout fund and a 106 billion euro ($148 billion) recapitalization of European banks.

However, economists fear the plan still lacks the heft and detail needed to ensure the debt crisis wonâ€™t again surface to threaten major euro-zone economies, such as Italy, and the regionâ€™s banking sector.

â€œThe plans announced by euro-zone policy makers overnight look more like a pea shooter than the â€˜bazookaâ€™ previously promised to tackle the regionâ€™s problems,â€� said Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics.

The firm still expects the crisis to deepen in coming quarters, ultimately resulting in a breakup of the euro, he said.

Others were less pessimistic, but portrayed the agreement as offering more of a breathing space that gives policy makers time to implement other needed measures rather than a lasting solution.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and France's President Nicolas Sarkozy at a joint briefing last week.

â€œTo our minds, this is likely to prove sufficient to ease financial stress and give the euro area a window of opportunity to put its house in order,â€� wrote economists Michala Marcussen and James Nixon at Societe Generale.

Financial markets have tended to rally in the wake of past crisis summits, only to see investors disappointed as subsequent events show policy makers remain behind the curve.

The Wednesday summit â€” the second gathering of EU leaders in four days â€” follows a July 21 gathering that had been touted as a lasting solution.

Greeceâ€™s debt load

The plan, meanwhile, lacks any strategy to boost growth in the euro zone, where countries have been encouraged to emphasize austerity in an effort to bring down debt levels, analysts said.

The program â€œmay offer some support for now, but the underlying economic dynamics of the deal imply a lot more economic misery, centered around pressure on banks and pressure on countries to deliver more austerity,â€� said Steven Barrow, currency and fixed-income strategist at Standard Bank.

â€œAnd, whatever officials deliver in terms of support now, if the euro-zone economy weakens materially (as seems very likely), the debt dynamics will get worse and this deal wonâ€™t be sufficient,â€� he said.

The biggest source of relief for markets appears to stem from an agreement by big banks to accept a voluntary 50% writedown on their holdings of Greek government bonds, up significantly from a 21% writedown implied in the July 21 agreement.

The talks had appeared deadlocked late Wednesday over the issue, raising fears European officials could move to impose an involuntary writedown on bondholders.

That would have been likely to constitute a â€œcredit event,â€� requiring the payout of billions of euros in credit default swaps, financial instruments used to protect debt against non-payment and potentially destabilizing the banking sector.

The writedowns aim to bring Greeceâ€™s public debt down to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020.

It also forms part of a â‚¬100 billion rescue plan for Greece that aims to keep the country funded through 2014.

Loynes from Capital Economics contends the reduction in Greeceâ€™s debt-to-GDP ratio, which has been forecast to peak north of 180% in 2013, wonâ€™t be enough to put its debt load on a sustainable footing.

That still leaves Greece with a debt load similar to Italyâ€™s.

Italy, unlike Greece, enjoys a primary budget surplus, meaning that it is servicing existing debt rather than creating new debt.

France's President Nicolas Sarkozy announces a deal on Greek debt writedowns at the end of a euro-zone summit in Brussels.

SYDNEY (MarketWatch) â€” European leaders announced a deal early Thursday in which private investors in Greek government debt will take a 50% writedown on the value of their holdings as part of a wide-ranging package of measures designed to stem the euro-zone debt crisis.

The haircut will be a voluntary agreement with private creditors and is expected to be finalized by the start of 2012.

An involuntary writedown could have potentially constituted a â€œcredit eventâ€� that would have required the payout on billions of euros in credit default swaps, instruments used to insure debt against non-payment.

Media reports earlier this week had put a possible haircut on Greek government bonds at between 40% and 60%.

Market reaction and a look into what this means for the European Union, banks, bondholders and the possible involvement of the Chinese.

The writedown on Greek debt forms a crucial part of a package of measures that emerged from a marathon European summit, which began Wednesday evening and represented the latest effort to tackle the two-year-old sovereign-debt crisis.

European stock markets soared on news of the deal, with the German DAX 30 index /quotes/zigman/2380246 DX:DAX +0.13% Â rallying 3.8%. Read more about European stocks.

The euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/sampled EURUSD -0.1533% Â traded at $1.3996, up from $1.3911 in late North American trading on Wednesday.

The shared currency topped the $1.40 level versus the dollar for the first time since early September.

â€œFrom a series of national debt crises, the situation was evolving into a systemic concern, threatening the stability of the euro zone as whole.

This threat has to be contained,â€� said European Council President Herman Van Rompuy after the summit ended.

â€œIn taking todayâ€™s decisions, we lay the foundations for our future.

All members of the euro summit are determined to follow this path,â€� he added.

See text of European Council presidentâ€™s statement.

Greece;

EFSF leverage

As part of the proposed plan, Greece will reduce its public debt to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020 and will also receive a new European Union/International Monetary Fund finance program of up to 100 billion euros ($140 billion) by the end of the year.

But details of the plan for writedowns have yet to be finalized.

Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based trade group that represents the worldâ€™s largest banks, said the group would work with Greece, euro-zone authorities and the International Monetary Fund to develop a concrete, voluntary agreement that should set the basis for a decline in Greeceâ€™s debt to GDP ratio to 120% by 2020.

â€œThe specific terms and conditions of the voluntary [private-sector involvement] will be agreed by all relevant parties in the coming period and implemented with immediacy and force,â€� Dallara said, in a statement.

â€œThe structure of the new Greek claims will need to be based on terms and conditions that ensure [a net present value] loss for investors fully consistent with a voluntary agreement.â€�

Additionally, the firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility will be increased by as much as five-fold or about â‚¬1 trillion.

At present, the â‚¬440-billion fund has between â‚¬250 billion and â‚¬275 billion available after the bailouts of Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

DJ Expectations Of China Help For EFSF 'Premature' - EU Diplomat

BRUSSELS, Oct 26, 2011 (Dow Jones Commodities News Select via Comtex) --

By Costas Paris and David Gauthier-Villars

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Hopes by the euro zone that China will invest to boost the firing power of European Financial Stability Facility may be premature, a senior EU diplomat said Wednesday.

"I wouldn't hold my breath for the Chinese.

First we will have to have a clear agreement on the EFSF, set up the special purpose vehicle, and then go to them with a comprehensive proposal on what they would get in return," said the diplomat, who is participating in talks at the EU summit in Brussels.

"It's too early and premature to get our hopes up."

A French government official said earlier Wednesday that President Nicolas Sarkozy plans to call China's President Hu Jintao on Thursday to discuss how Beijing might contribute to a euro-zone rescue fund aimed at buying sovereign debt issued by Greece and other troubled Southern European countries.

The two heads of state will also discuss the agenda of a November summit in Cannes, France, where leaders of the world's 20 largest industrialized nations are expected to review how the euro zone is dealing with its protracted sovereign-debt crisis, the official said.

Among other solutions, euro-zone governments are considering setting up a fund that would be fed primarily by European countries, but would also receive investments from outside contributors such as China, through a special purpose vehicle.

France, Germany and other euro-zone governments have vowed to come up with a comprehensive package of solutions by Wednesday evening to solve the sovereign debt crisis.

BRIEF:

EXTRA: Summit proves EU has learned crisis lessons, Merkel says

BRUSSELS, Oct 27, 2011 (dpa - McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via COMTEX) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel said early Thursday that the crisis resolution plan pulled together by European Union leaders overnight showed that they could "draw the right conclusions" from the financial woes plaguing the eurozone.

"I am very aware that the world was watching these debates today," she told reporters at the end of a marathon session of EU and eurozone leaders' meetings in Brussels.

She specifically pointed to an agreement reached with banks over cutting the value of their Greek holdings, noting that they are now "substantial" participants in the rescue of the debt-laden country.

German chancellor Angela Merkel warned the ‘peace and prosperity’ of Europe could not be guaranteed as her parliament approved a plan to  increase Europe’s financial safety net fourfold.

‘No one should think that a further half century of peace and prosperity is assured.

It isn’t,’ she said.

‘And that’s why I say if the euro fails, Europe will fail – and that mustn’t happen.

‘The world is looking at Germany, whether we are strong enough to accept responsibility for the biggest crisis since the Second World War.’

Mrs Merkel’s plan to boost the European Financial Stability Facility was agreed in order to stop a collapse of confidence in the euro, as Italy and Spain look close to joining Greece, Portugal and Ireland in needing  assistance.

A recapitalisation of Europe’s vulnerable banks – none in Britain – has also been agreed in principle.

Their reserves will be increased by more than €100billion (£87billion).

Details of the plan will be thrashed out by national finance ministers on Saturday but a final decision on the deal is not expected until November.

Leaving the first meeting in Brussels, prime minister David Cameron – who was criticised at the weekend for ‘interfering’ in eurozone matters – said:

‘We made good progress tonight.

It is very much in Britain’s interest that we sort out these problems and solve this crisis.’

But Martin Callanan MEP, leader of the Conservatives in Europe, said:

‘Once again we are being told this is the make-or-break summit.

‘I believe we have had 14 such summits in a little over 18 months but the problem they need to address keeps getting deeper.

‘None of them has worked because none has addressed the fundamental problem at the heart of the Euro project:

the yawning gap between the economic viability of Greece and Germany.’

Uncertainty over Europe has hit bond prices but global stock markets have been rising steadily over the past few days amid speculation a deal will be reached.

Morgan Stanley strategist Kevin Flanagan said markets would not stabilise until the fine print was agreed.

David Cameron prepares, at the British Residence in Brussels (Pic:PA)

DAVID Cameron had to sit on the sidelines last night as the heads of countries in the euro met to try to strike a deal to save the currency.

The Prime Minister was only invited to take part in an informal hour-long summit of all 27 EU nations in Brussels.

He was then left hanging around hoping 17 leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and France’s President Nicolas Sarkozy could thrash out a deal.

Ms Merkel had dealt Mr Cameron an early blow by demanding European Union treaty changes and an international tax on city fatcats he opposes.

Then he got another slap in the face when Euro MPs in Strasbourg ignored the eurozone crisis and voted for a 6.6billion euro – or 5.2% – rise in Europe’s 2012 budget.

That would take EU spending over 130billion euros next year and increase Britain’s bill by more than £700million.

He will now have to appeal to MEPs to honour their pledge to keep costs down.

But this will mean teaming up with Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy, who appeared to snub him at yesterday’s informal talks.

Mr Cameron said after yesterday’s meeting:

“We made some good progress.

It’s very much in Britain’s interests that we solve this crisis.

“We have made good progress on the bank recapitalisation.

That wasn’t watered down, it has been agreed.”

But he added that would only happen after “other parts of a full package go ahead” at the meeting he was excluded from.

Leaders were last night trying to strike a three-part deal including writing off up to 60% of Greece’s debts.

They also hoped to agree on how much more money Europe’s banks should horde to protect them from the losses.

And they had to figure out how to boost the eurozone bailout fund to more than £1trillion to stop the crisis spreading to other countries with big debts such as Silvio Berlusconi’s Italy.

Ms Merkel’s fatcats demand angered Tory MPs who staged a mutiny over Europe this week.

Mark Pritchard, secretary of the powerful 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives, said:

“This provides the opportunity for Britain to repatriate significant powers back from Europe.”

The Prime Minister has said he wants to cut the powers of Brussels but Deputy PM Nick Clegg opposes it.

Labour leader Ed Miliband taunted Mr Cameron over the Tory split at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday.

He said:

“We have a Prime Minister who has spent the last week pleading with his backbenchers, not leading for Britain.” Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander said last night the Prime Minister must fight the “inflation busting” 5.2% EU budget rise.

He said:

“Last time the PM promised a freeze and then came out claiming that a rise was a victory.

This time David Cameron must do better – he must not support another inflation busting rise in the EU budget.”

A Downing Street spokesman said:

“Britain – along with France, Germany and others – will push for a more realistic proposal.”

The European heads of state hoped the outcome of last night’s summit would be positive enough to avoid a meltdown in the money markets.

Ms Merkel had even warned European countries could end up warring with each other if the euro collapses.

She told the German parliament:

“No one should think that a further half century of peace and prosperity is assured.

If the euro fails, Europe will fail.”

The FTSE 100 had a late rally last night to overcome losses triggered by fears that EU leaders would not reach agreement.

Eurozone leaders and banks are close to reaching a deal on a 50%writedown for private bondholders on their Greek debt, an EU source said on Thursday.

Negotiations at a summit meeting of eurozone leaders were centred on agreeing a writedown or "haircut" with private bondholders on a voluntary basis.

Eurozone states want private investors to accept the haircut in an effort to reduce Greece's debt burden by about 100 billion euros.

Failure to agree on a voluntary writedown could lead to a full-scale default in Greece's debt, with a heavy knock-on impact on markets.

German sources said Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were now negotiating directly with representatives of the banking industry to try to forge a deal in which the banks will accept a writedown of at least 50% on their holdings of Greek government bonds.

The talks were expected to drag on into the night, with positions far apart on perhaps the most complex element of the three-part "comprehensive package" that euro zone leaders are trying to pull together.

"They only started now on the hard core of the matter, which is the PSI (private sector involvement)," one EU source said.

However, the leaders earlier made progress on two other elements - bank recapitalisation and moves to scale up the size of the eurozone's 440 billion euro (USD 600 billion) bailout fund.

A draft statement from the summit, obtained by Reuters, outlined two options to leverage the fund designed to shore up heavily indebted states and thwart market attacks.

It said details would not be nailed down until next month, suggesting the second summit in four days will have sketched broad intentions but failed to produce a detailed master plan to resolve a crisis that threatens the single currency project.

Those three elements are so intertwined that euro zone leaders face an all-or-nothing showdown.

"It is going to disappoint the market, particularly given the emphasis policymakers put on this meeting," said Jessica Hoversen, foreign exchange analyst at MF Global in New York.

A senior EU source said the eurozone leaders wanted private sector creditors to accept a writedown of 50% or more on their holdings of Greek government debt to reduce Greece's total outstanding private sector debt by around 100 billion euros.

While there is consensus on the need for European banks to raise around 110 billion euros (USD 150 billion) in extra capital to withstand a potential Greek debt default, governments and banks are at odds over the scale of write-offs.

"There has been no agreement on any Greek deal or a specific 'haircut'," Charles Dallara, head of the Institute for International Finance which represents private sector creditors, said in a statement.

"There is no agreement on any element of a deal."

Sources said the IIF could present another offer, a move that is likely to further extend negotiations.

For the European Financial Stability Facility, where more progress was made, one proposal involves creating a special purpose investment vehicle (SPIV) to tap foreign sovereign and private investors, such as Chinese and Middle Eastern wealth funds, to buy bonds of troubled eurozone countries.

The other method for scaling up the rescue fund, which was set up last year, involves using it to offer partial guarantees to purchasers of new euro zone debt.

The two options could be used simultaneously and the International Monetary Fund could also help.

Eurozone finance ministers will be asked to finalise the terms and conditions in November, the statement said.

EU sources said the EFSF was expected to be leveraged by something like a factor of four giving it scope of around 1 trillion euros.

It has about 250-275 billion euros available given funds set aside for aid to Greece, Ireland and Portugal and for recapitalising the region's banks.

Sarkozy is expected to talk with Chinese President Hu Jintao soon on Beijing's participation in the bailout fund.

US stocks rallied on the pledge to boost the power of the fund, while the euro fell as investors awaited details that will not be forthcoming until next month.

Earlier, Merkel said it was a crunch time for Europe, while defending its long track record of peace and prosperity.

"No one should take for it for granted that there will be peace and affluence in Europe in the next half century," said Merkel, a pastor's daughter from Communist eastern Germany.

"The world is watching Germany and Europe to see if we are ready and able to take responsibility.

If the euro fails, Europe fails," said Merkel, in a characteristically sober tone.

European leaders' pattern of responding too little, too late to a debt crisis that began in Greece has spawned a wider economic and political crisis that threatens to undermine the euro single currency and the European Union project.

EU leaders agreed the outlines of a package on bank recapitalisation, including raising the core capital ratios of European banks to 9% by the end of June 2012, but they did not provide a headline figure, which will depend in part on negotiations over Greek debt.

The European Banking Authority said the eurozone banks needed to raise 106 billion euros of capital to meet that ratio with Greek and Spanish banks facing the most work.

Italian Intent

Merkel won a parliamentary vote of support for strengthening the rescue fund after warning in a dramatic speech that Europe was facing its most difficult situation since the end of World War Two.

Merkel told parliament that private bondholders would have to take a substantial write-down so that Greece's debt could be reduced to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020 from 160% this year.

Experts said that implied a 50% "haircut" for private investors.

Also weighing on the summit was deep concern about Italy, which is now in the bond market firing line.

Under huge pressure from its eurozone partners, Rome promised a package of reform steps to boost growth and control its public debt, including labour and pensions reforms and additional revenues from property divestments.

In a letter sent to the summit in Brussels, the government said it would produce a plan of action to boost growth by November 15, promising to raise the retirement age to 67, cut red tape and modernise state administration to improve conditions for business and raise 5 billion euros a year from divestments and improved returns from state property.

Rome's inability to deliver a substantive plan for reforming its pensions system has raised doubts about Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's seriousness in tackling a crisis that threatens the euro zone's third largest economy.

Italy has the euro zone's largest sovereign bond market, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, 120% of GDP. If it went the same way as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the rescue fund would not have enough money to bail Rome out.

Mario Draghi, the incoming head of the European Central Bank threw the eurozone a lifeline hours before the summit, signalling the ECB would go on buying troubled states' bonds as leaders of the 17-nation single currency area struggled to agree a convincing set of measures.

"The Eurosystem (of central banks) is determined, with its non-conventional measures, to prevent malfunctioning in the money and financial markets creating an obstacle to monetary transmission," he said in typically coded ECB language in a speech text released in Rome.

Draghi, who will succeed Jean-Claude Trichet on November 1, made clear that measures could only be a temporary expedient and said it was up to governments to tackle the roots of the debt crisis that began in Greece two years ago.

However, his statement appeared to rebuff pressure from Germany's powerful Bundesbank for the ECB to end the bond-buying programme which prompted the resignation of the two most senior German ECB policymakers this year.

More work to be done, Merkel says at last-chance EU summit

Brussels - German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned on  Wednesday that more work remained to be done as she arrived for a  European Union summit in Brussels that has been billed as a  last-chance occasion to address the eurozone crisis.

'We still have a whole range of problems to solve and negotiations  to conduct,' she told reporters.

'Our work is not done yet. But  I think that everybody is traveling here with the goal of definitely  making significant progress.'

The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde,  said she was under the impression that there was a general sense of  'good will' as she arrived for the summit.

EU leaders strike deal on bank recapitalization plan

Oct 26, 2011, 18:39 GMT

Brussels - European Union leaders agreed Wednesday on a bank  recapitalization plan, representatives from the bloc's Polish  presidency said after a summit meeting in Brussels.

Under a European Banking Authority plan, banks are to be required  to hold 9-per-cent core Tier 1 capital ratio - a measure of their  wealth.

The benchmark previously used in summer banking stress tests  had been 5 per cent.

Banks will need more capital as EU regulators will force them to  acknowledge the lower value of government bonds from troubled  eurozone countries they hold in their books - meaning a 50-60 per  cent write down in the case of Greece.

Banks are separately being asked to forfeit at least 50 per cent  of the loans to Greece as part of efforts to reduce that country's  crippling debt mountain.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk assured  that the mark down rule 'is not a permanent solution for the future.'

EU agrees on bank plan, eurozone problems remain unresolved

Oct 26, 2011, 19:47 GMT

Brussels - European Union leaders meeting in Brussels on  Wednesday agreed on a recapitalization plan designed to help banks  weather the eurozone storm, but other elements of the single  currency's crisis resolution plan were still unresolved.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that after a 'heated' and  'emotional' debate it was decided that banks should be forced to  acknowledge the lower value of government bonds from troubled  eurozone countries they hold in their books.

Lenders will also be required to hold on to more top quality  capital, reaching 9 per cent in the core Tier 1 capital ratio, as  opposed to the 5-per-cent threshold used in July stress tests.

Banks will be expected to raise the missing capital on the  markets.

Failing that, they can turn to governments and, as a last  resort available only to euro area institutions, to the single  currency's bailout fund.

Banks will also face 'constraints regarding the distribution of  dividends and bonus payments' until they meet the 9-per-cent goal, an  EU statement said.

Reports on the weekend indicated that recapitalization would cost  about 100 billion euros, or 139 billion dollars.

Polish Finance  Minister Jacek Rostowski said the final figure depended on parallel  talks with banks about the size of their Greek 'haircuts.'

Lenders are separately being asked to forfeit at least 50 per cent  of the loans to Greece - as opposed to the 21-per-cent figure agreed  to in July - as part of efforts to reduce that country's crippling  mountain of debt.

'Enough is enough, the private sector also needs to take the share  of responsibility,' Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said.

Amid reports of a deadlock with banks, eurozone leaders were  discussing the haircut options in a meeting after the EU summit.

Also  on the agenda was the similarly thorny issue of leveraging the  eurozone bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF).

With speculation rife that additional eurozone rescue funds could  be solicited from the International Monetary Fund and emerging  countries, the EFSF said its chief Klaus Regling would visit China on  Friday.

British Prime Minister David Cameron noted that eurozone decisions  would determine whether the EU's bank recapitalization plan would be  implemented, saying that 'further progress on that needs to happen  tonight.'

Others were more cautious.

'I don't think we'll get a final solution tonight,' Swedish Prime  Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt told reporters.

'This is technically very  difficult ... I think it's better to do it slowly, in a way which  creates long-term confidence.'

Before meetings started, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned  that there were still 'a whole range of problems to solve and  negotiations to conduct.'

The leaders' aim was to end Greece's debt problems, prevent the  crisis from spreading to Italy and regain market confidence in the  eurozone's ability to pull itself together.

'We probably won't be able to formulate every last detail, but the  general course must be ultra clear,' said Jean-Claude Juncker, the  influential chairman of the Eurogroup panel of eurozone finance  ministers.

Italy was in the limelight as the eurozone's latest problem  child.

Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was under intense pressure to  calm contagion fears by implementing promised austerity and growth  measures.

At their last euro summit on Sunday, French, German and EU leaders  gave Berlusconi an ultimatum to follow up on his reform commitments  by Wednesday.

Berlusconi responded by promising pension reforms, privatizations  and a loosening of labour market laws, among other measures, within  'eight months,' according to a letter published on Italian news  sites.

The commitments 'have made a very good impression and were very  well received,' Tusk said.

European leaders are scrambling to meet a pledge to prevent a  global spillover of the eurozone debt crisis in time for a summit of  Group of 20 major economies in Cannes, France, on November 3-4.

'Everyone understands that the whole world is looking at us,'  Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said.

EU strikes deals on banks, EFSF - Greek hurdle remains

By Alexandra Mayer-Hohdahl and Alvise Armellini Oct 27, 2011, 0:18 GMT

Brussels - A eurozone crisis resolution plan was emerging  early Thursday, after deals were struck on bank recapitalizations and  a beefed-up bailout fund - but banks were still resisting demands to  take a bigger hit on Greece.

Euro area leaders meeting in Brussels have agreed to stretch the  firepower of the 440-billion-euro (612-billion-dollar) European  Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to up to 1 trillion euros via  leveraging, diplomats said.

The extra capacity is needed to shield the likes of Italy and  Spain from a Greek-style debt crisis.

Parallel talks on another key plank of the eurozone's strategy -  convincing banks to accept a bigger voluntary 'haircut' on Greece in  order to cut down the country's debt mountain - did not advance.

European leaders want private lenders to accept losses of at least  50 per cent, instead of the 21-per-cent figure that was negotiated in  July.

The writedown needs to be voluntary to avoid triggering market  panic.

But the private lenders' chief negotiator, Institute of  International Finance Managing Director Charles Dallara, insisted  late Wednesday that 'there has been no agreement on any Greek deal or  a specific haircut.'

'We remain open to a dialogue in search of a voluntary agreement.

There is no agreement on any element of a deal,' he added.

Diplomats said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French  President Nicolas Sarkozy and the influential chairman of the  Eurogroup panel of eurozone finance ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker,  were directly involved in talks with the lenders.

Earlier, an EU-wide summit had decided to force banks to  temporarily acknowledge the lower value of government bonds from  troubled eurozone countries that they hold in their books.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the decision came after a  'heated' and 'emotional' debate over the markdown obligation.

Lenders will be required to hold on to more top-quality capital,  reaching 9 per cent in the core Tier 1 capital ratio, as opposed to  the 5-per-cent threshold used in July stress tests.

Banks will be expected to raise the missing capital on the  markets.

Failing that, they can turn to governments and, as a last  resort available only to euro area institutions, to the single  currency's bailout fund.

They will face 'constraints regarding the distribution of  dividends and bonus payments' until they meet the 9-per-cent goal, an  EU statement said.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) said recapitalization would  involve 70 institutions and would cost 106 billion euros.

Greek,  Spanish and Italian banks, followed by lenders in France, Portugal  and Germany, would need the biggest cash infusions, the EBA  predicted.

EU officials hinted that a deadlock on the Greek haircut could  threaten the deals reached on recapitalizations and the EFSF.

'Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,' one of them told dpa.

British Prime Minister David Cameron also said that the  EU-approved bank recapitalization plan was dependent on the 17-member  euro area delivering 'a full package.'

Wednesday's EU and eurozone emergency summits came as Europeans  scramble to deliver a plan to prevent a global spillover of the debt  crisis plaguing the eurozone, in time for a summit of the Group of 20  major economies on November 3-4 in Cannes, France.

'Everyone understands that the whole world is looking at us,'  Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said after meeting with  her 26 EU counterparts in Brussels.

Other leaders had played down expectations about what could be  achieved Wednesday, fueling speculation that more EU meetings would  be needed, on top of the marathon of gatherings Brussels has held  since Friday.

Merkel warned that there remained 'a whole range of problems to  solve and negotiations to conduct,' while Sarkozy - the other key  eurozone player - had yet to comment seven hours into the meetings.

'We probably won't be able to formulate every last detail, but the  general course must be ultra clear,' said Juncker, who also serves as  Luxembourg's prime minister.

Italy had threatened to present another worry, but a reform plan  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was instructed to deliver in time  for the summit in order to calm contagion fears seemed to have won  over European peers.

The country also received a boost as the incoming president of the  European Central Bank, Italy's Mario Draghi, indicated that the  Frankfurt-based institution would continue buying bonds of troubled  eurozone states.

In a letter to EU institutions, Berlusconi promised a flurry of  measures within eight months on pensions, privatizations and the  labour market, according to a copy published on Italian news sites.

His responses 'made a very good impression and were very well  received,' Tusk said.

Merkel presses for strictness on Greece, new EU powers

Berlin - Chancellor Angela Merkel pressed Wednesday for  strict supervision of Greece while it is being nursed back to  economic health, and demanded stronger EU powers to punish states  that breach eurozone stability rules.

Speaking to the German parliament hours before a fresh European  summit in Brussels on the eurozone crisis, Merkel gave no details of  the 'haircut' that EU leaders are expected to seek, forcing public  and private lenders to forgive a major part of Greek debt.

But she said the aim should be to reduce Greece's sovereign debt  to 120 per cent of its annual gross domestic product by 2020.

'We must tackle the cause of the crisis at the root,' said Merkel.

She said the eurozone crisis had been caused by two factors:

excessive debt and a lack of competitiveness.

Merkel said the eurozone needed a 'firewall' to prevent contagion  from weak borrowers such as Greece, and added that aid to struggling  eurozone economies 'must always be linked to strict conditions.'

Merkel called for 'the weaknesses and mistakes of construction  during the creation of the economic and monetary union to be fixed.'

'The next step is to gain influence over countries that  permanently and repeatedly breach the Stability and Growth Pact,' she  said, referring to the rules that ban annual budgetary deficits of  more than 3 per cent of an EU member's gross domestic product.

She said Germany would ask the EU to begin the process to amend  the European treaties in December, so that states breaching the  stability guidelines could be sanctioned before the European Court of  Justice.

Merkel welcomed broad parliamentary support in Germany for two new  methods to boost the firepower of the European Financial Stability  Facility (EFSF).

A resolution was to be passed mid-afternoon.

One method will allow the EFSF to partly guarantee the bonds of  heavily indebted eurozone states to make them more attractive for  investors.

The other would allow a new entity with International  Monetary Fund backing to buy those bonds directly.

Merkel said the negotiations in Brussels would 'not be easy,' but  praised the joint mandate she was to be given, saying it showed that  there was a cross-party commitment to supporting European unity.

The summit was to be the second in four days.

On Sunday, Merkel  applied heavy pressure on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to  'do his homework' on cutting Italian public borrowing.

Without mentioning Italy by name, Merkel issued a veiled warning  she said was prompted 'by the political situation in certain nations  in Europe,' saying, 'No one should believe another half century of  peace and affluence will happen by itself.'

Frank-Walter Steinmeier, parliamentary leader of the opposition  Social Democrats (SPD), criticized the time it had taken Merkel's  government to come up with an answer to the two-year eurozone debt  crisis.

'I would like to have heard many of these statements a year ago,'  he said, adding that key parts of the plan that Merkel had set out -  bank recapitalization and writing down Greek debt - had been raised  by the SPD some time ago.

Within Merkel's governing coalition, 16 of 330 deputies plan to  oppose the joint resolution or abstain, straw polls showed.

But the  handful of conservative mavericks, who believe the bailouts will  undermine Germany's financial health, cannot block the resolution.

The chancellor defended the financial risks that Germany was  accepting by backing a broader bailout.

'The risk from the currently planned maximization of the EFSF is  acceptable,' Merkel said.

'I would go as far as to say, it would not  be responsible to refuse to take the risk.'

Following are coming events linked to the debt crisis in the euro zone:

EUROPEAN UNION:

Nov. 7 â€“ Meeting of Eurogroup in Brussels.

Nov. 8 â€“ Meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels.

Nov. 29 â€“ Meeting of Eurogroup in Brussels.

Nov. 30 â€“ Meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels.

Dec. 9 â€“ Summit of EU heads of state and government in Brussels.

G7/G8/G20 MEETINGS:

Nov. 3, 4 â€“ G20 annual summit in Cannes, France.

If no new euro zone crisis-fighting steps are firmed up by this point, markets are likely to react badly.

President Barack Obama has demanded concrete plans in time for the summit.

GREECE:

POLITICS:

* Greece is awaiting the final plan European Union leaders will adopt to lighten its debt burden, fortify European banks to withstand bond losses, and scale up the euro zone rescue fund to prevent market contagion.

Athens wants the debt relief to come with assurances safeguarding its banking system â€“ mainly depositors.

* Euro zone finance ministers approved on Oct. 21 the payment of the next tranche of 8 billion euros ($11 billion) under Greeceâ€™s EU/IMF bailout program.

The tranche must be paid by mid-November if Greece is to avoid running out of money.

* The Greek parliament approved a painful set of austerity measures ahead of the Oct. 23, 26 EU summit on the debt crisis.

* A voluntary swap of government bonds with longer maturity paper under a July deal will be substituted with a new scheme, requiring private creditors to shoulder bigger writedowns on their Greek bond holdings to lighten and stretch the debt burden.

Euro zone authorities are negotiating haircuts of 50 per cent or more with banks.

GOVERNMENT DEBT SUPPLY:

* Monthly T-bill sales are Greeceâ€™s sole remaining route to market funding.

The debt-choked country rolled over 4 billion euros of T-bills that matured in October.

* Greece also paid two bond coupons that came due on Oct. 24, a total of 1.059 billion euros.

* Its debt agency needs to roll over a total of 3.6 billion euros of T-bills in November â€“ 2 billion euros of six-month paper mature on Nov. 11 and 1.6 billion in three-month T-bills on Nov. 18.

* Nov. 4 â€“ Debt agency sets amount of six-month T-bills it will auction on Nov. 8.

ITALY:

* Italy, after a long period of prevarication, passed a much-altered austerity plan in September to try to steer clear of the debt crisis but its bond yields are only being kept at manageable levels with European Central Bank support.

* After heavy pressure from France and Germany, the government promised additional measures, including a rise in the basic pension age to 67 by 2026, loosening of job protection rules and rules allowing civil servants to be put on so-called Cassa Integrazione, mandatory stand-down at minimum pay.

* EU partners have been annoyed at slow progress by Italy on promised reforms needed to head off the need for outside help.

The consensus view is that an Italian bailout would overwhelm existing euro zone rescue funds.

POLITICS:

Oct. 28 â€“ Berlusconi expected to attend graft trial where he is accused of bribing British lawyer David Mills.

November â€“ Potentially sensitive political discussions on implementing the new reform measures promised by the government.

Unions have already expressed strong opposition to weakening job protection measures.

Relations within Berlusconiâ€™s centre-right coalition already severely strained over pension reforms.

DEBT ISSUES:

Oct 28 â€“ Auction of new tranches of three- and 10-year BTP benchmarks with additional tranches of off-the-run BTPs and floating-rate CCTeu bonds for a total of between 5.25 billion and 8.5 billion euros.

GERMANY:

POLITICS:

* The Free Democrats (FDP), junior coalition partner in Chancellor Angela Merkelâ€™s centre-right government, will hold an internal vote in December to determine their partyâ€™s stance on German contributions to European bailouts.

* The FDP will hold a party congress in Frankfurt from Nov. 12 to 13. The euro debt crisis will be a major theme.

* Merkelâ€™s Christian Democrats (CDU) will hold a party congress in Leipzig Nov. 13 to 15, where the euro crisis will also be a major theme.

* At some point in the next week or two, either the Bundestag, lower house of parliament, or the parliaments budget committee will vote on the EFSF framework.

No date has been set yet.

SPAIN:

REFORM:

* The Bank of Spain took over three unlisted saving banks to wrap up a restructuring process.

State and private investors injected 13.4 billion euros into the savings banks, known as cajas, at the end of the process, a fraction of that estimated by analysts.

GENERAL ELECTIONS FOUR MONTHS EARLY:

* Spainâ€™s Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has brought forward general elections set for March 2012 to Nov. 20, 2011.

The conservative opposition Popular Party has a healthy poll lead.

Spain has gone a long way with its austerity measures but its decision to shelve a partial sale of the state lottery suggests electoral politics are starting to impinge.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Spain on Saturday to do more to win back market confidence.

DATA RELEASES

Oct. 28 â€“ Jobless survey Q3

Nov. 2 â€“ Manufacturing PMI

Nov. 4 â€“ Industrial output Sept.

Nov. 11 â€“ Q3 GDP flash release

Nov. 15 â€“ Inflation Oct. final

It has received 8.9 billion euros from the IMF and 18.1 billion from Europeâ€™s bailout funds.

* Officials from the ECB, EC and IMF completed the latest quarterly review of Irelandâ€™s bailout on Oct. 20 and said Dublin was meeting all its targets.

* Dublin has recapitalized the countryâ€™s four remaining lenders to meet its target under the EU-IMF bailout.

Europe finally delivers three point solution to euro debt crisis

Have European leaders found a plan to tackle the euro debt crisis that will work?

Thursday, 27 October 2011 12:08

European Union leaders have agreed a deal that covers the three main problems facing the euro.

The bailout funds available to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) will be increased to €1 trillion, an agreement to write-off 50 per cent of Greek debt and the earlier agreement at the weekend on recapitalising European banks mean that all three areas deemed as essential for a resolution of the euro debt crisis have been agreed.

How effective they will prove to be and whether they will provide a lasting solution and placate investors remains to be seen.

The early signs on the markets have been positive.

By late morning, the FTSE 100 was up by 2.4 per cent at 5,687.53, the German Dax had risen by more than four per cent to 6,261 and the French Cac index had also increased by more than four per cent to 3,304.

The deal will reduce Greek debt levels to 120 per cent of GDP by 2020 from its current level of 160 per cent of GDP, according to EU President Herman Van Rompuy.

The deal on recapitalising European banks will not involve UK banks but will force European banks to increase capital reserves by more than €100 billion, something which most UK banks have already done.

The deadline for European banks to do this is July 2012 and if they are unable to get the capital from private sources it will be taxpayers who cover the cost.

This, the first of the three pivotal issues, proved the easiest to agree.

The second part of negotiations involved trying to persuade the banks to take an increased hit on Greek debt.

In the end it was agreed that the banks will lose 50 per cent of their original investment by settling for repayment of just 50 per cent of Greek loans.

The third element of the agreement proved the toughest to find consensus on. The increase of the EFSF bailout fund to €440 billion had only been ratified by the last of the 17 members of the single currency, Slovakia, earlier this month.

This will be increased to around €1 trillion by using a special purpose investment vehicle (SPIV), which would make buying eurozone debts more attractive to foreign investors and a debt-insurance scheme sponsored by the state which would ensure that an investor in one nation’s bonds would get a refund were that country to default.

It is believed that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would also contribute to the EFSF fund.

The deal can only be finalised after EU finance ministers talk to foreign investors and gauge their views on European debt.

The proposals will be negotiated by the end of the year so that a complete second bailout package will be in place by then.

European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said:

"These are exceptional measures for exceptional times.

Europe must never again find itself in this situation."

EU leaders reach crisis deal

by:

What are these?

A EUROPEAN Union official says the currency union's leaders have reached a deal with banks to take losses of 50 per cent of their Greek bonds in a key move to solve the eurozone's debt crisis.

Greece will be able to reduce its debt by  100 billion euros  ($A134.27 billion), French President  Nicolas Sarkozy says.

"This represents an effort of 100 billion euros," Sarkozy told a   news conference after a marathon eurozone summit in Brussels today .

Eurozone leaders have also agreed to leverage  the firepower of their  bailout fund to one trillion euros ($A1.34  trillion).

He announced the agreement today at  the close of almost 10  hours of summit talks aimed at hammering out a  package of measures  to contain Europe's two-year debt crisis.

EU leaders reach crisis deal

EU leaders have reached a deal with banks to take losses of 50 per cent of their Greek bonds.

Picture: File Source:

The Australian

EUROPEAN leaders have agreed on a crucial plan to reduce Greece's debts and provide it with more rescue loans so that the faltering country can eventually dig out from under its debt burden.

After a marathon summit today,  EU  President Herman Van Rompuy said that the deal will reduce  Greece's  debt to 120 per cent of its GDP in 2020.

Under current  conditions, it  would have grown to 180 per cent.

That will require banks to  take on 50 per cent losses on their  Greek bond holdings - a hard-fought  deal that negotiators will now  have to sell to individual bondholders.

Mr Van Rompuy also said the eurozone and International Monetary  Fund -  which have both been propping the country up with loans  since May of  2010 - will give the country another 100 billion euros  ($A134.27  billion).

That's slightly less than amount agreed in  July, presumably  because the banks will now pick up more of the  slack.

"These  are exceptional measures for exceptional times.

Europe  must never find  itself in this situation again," European  Commission President Jose  Manuel Barroso said after the meetings.

The question of how to  reduce Greece's debt load had proven the  sticking point in European  leaders' efforts to come up with a grand  plan to solve its debt crisis.

But it was just one of three prongs necessary to restore  confidence  in Europe's ability to pay its debts and prevent the  two-year-old  crisis from pushing the continent and much of the  developed world back  into recession.

The first details of such a plan emerged hours  earlier, when  European Union leaders announced they would force the  continent's  biggest banks to raise 106 billion euros ($A142.33 billion)  by June  - partially to ensure they could weather the expected losses  on  Greek debt.

Mr Van Rompuy also announced that the eurozone  would boost the  firepower of their bailout fund to about  one trillion  euros  ($A1.34 trillion) in order to protect larger economies like Italy   and Spain from the market turmoil that has already pushed three   countries to need bailouts.

"We have reached an agreement which  I believe lets us give a  credible and ambitious and overall response  to the Greek crisis," French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters  as the meeting  broke today.

"Because of the complexity of  the issues  at stake, it took us a full night.

But the results will be a  source  of huge relief worldwide."

Europe Asks China for Bailout Help

But China wants guarantees first

(NEWSER) - The head of the eurozone bailout fund met with Chinese leaders yesterday to urge them to invest in its rescue scheme.

No agreement has been reached yet—indeed, Klaus Regling said that there weren’t even formal negotiations—but the expectation is that China will toss about $100 billion into what will ultimately be a $1 trillion fund, the BBC reports.

But China has indicated that it’ll need ironclad guarantees of its investment’s safety.

Letting Greece Join Euro Was a Mistake

Country wasn't ready to be part of eurozone, he says

(NEWSER) - Nicolas Sarkzoy has made it clear that tensions remain in the eurozone despite agreement on a debt crisis deal . The French president says that while he backs reforms intended to allow Greece to remain in the euro, it was a mistake to let the country join the single currency a decade ago because the country's economic figures were false and it wasn't ready, the Guardian reports.

"If the euro had exploded on Wednesday night, all of Europe would have exploded," he told French TV. "If Greece had defaulted there would have been a domino effect carrying everyone away."

Berlin-Paris Flap Delays Euro Bailout

Agreement impossible until next week, Merkel and Sarkozy say

(NEWSER) - This weekend's European summit was supposed to produce an agreement that would avert financial doom for the eurozone, but it has failed before it even began.

Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel have issued a joint statement admitting that it will be impossible to reach a deal this weekend and a second summit will have to be held on Wednesday, the Guardian reports.

France and Germany are split on the size of the bailout vehicle needed, with France pushing for a bigger entity capable of doling out more than $2.75 trillion in loans to troubled European economies.

1 Dead in Athens Protests

Victim may have suffered heart attack

(NEWSER) - An Athens anti-austerity demonstration turned violent today when rioters attacked peaceful protesters, and one ended up dead.

Rioters threw firebombs and chunks of marble at the tens of thousands who had turned out in the Greek capital hours before lawmakers were scheduled to vote on the unpopular austerity measures creditors are demanding before releasing additional bailout funds to the struggling country.

But initial reports suggest the 53-year-old who died may have had a heart attack rather than succumbing to violence, the AP reports.

NEWS FROM OUR PARTNERS

By Jon E. Dougherty at 27 Oct 08:45

(Newsroom America) -- European Union leaders on Thursday reached an agreement with holders of Greece's debt that would see private investors take a 50 percent cut in the value of their bonds, a deal that officials believe will reduce the financially troubled nation's debt levels to 120 percent of gross domestic product within a decade.

The agreement followed marathon negotiations that lasted about 11 hours and culminated with a deal that includes a €130bn infusion of cash from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

"Debt sustainability for Greece can only be established if the private sector participates in a substantial way," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, following the deal.

"The world had its eyes on us today."

The Greek bargain was the most contentious of a three-pronged approach Eurozone leaders agreed to pursue that they hopeful will finally address the continent's worsening debt crisis.

Part of that plan includes boosting the value of a €440bn bail-out fund by providing "risk insurance" for new bonds issued by economies that are struggling the most, the Financial Times reported.

It's an approach that could potentially be used to help Italy's struggling economy, but Eurozone leaders did not say what amount would eventually be covered by the insurance.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he would be speaking to China's president, Hu Jintao, on Friday, to discuss any role Beijing may have in bolstering or supporting the bail-out fund.

Hopes are fading that a plan to fix the eurozone debt crisis will emerge from today’s emergency summit of EU leaders.

The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is warning that there are still many problems to settle and negotiations to carry out.

The Taoiseach says he wants major decisions made today but Enda Kenny is  warning that any deal should not mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty.

One of Colonel Gaddafi’s surviving sons has apparently offered to hand himself in.

Libya’s new leaders – the National Transitional Council – claim Saif  al-Islam is proposing to turn himself over to the International Criminal  Court at the Hague.

He’s wanted by the ICC for crimes against humanity and has been on the run since the fall of his father’s regime.

The crisis in emergency department’s around the country appears to be getting worse.

The latest figures from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation shows  that there are currently 429 patients waiting on trolleys and chairs in  our A and E departments, awaiting admission.

University College Hospital in Galway is worst effected – with 44 patients there awaiting a bed.

European MEPs in Strasbourg have today agreed to freeze their expenses for next year.

At the moment MEPs are entitled to a monthly allowance of four thousand  two hundred euro for their office and other working expenses.

They’re also entitled to travel expenses provided they send in receipts.

And on top of that MEPs also get a daily allowance of three hundred and  two euro which is supposed to cover their daily accommodation and living  expenses.

A verdict of misadventure has been recorded at an inquest into Amy Winehouse’s death.

EU leaders have agreed a rescue deal for the Euro after marathon talks in Brussels.

They have put together a €106 billion plan to re-capitalise banks in exchange for them agreeing to write-off half of Greek debts.

Eurozone politicians have also decided to significantly increase the size of their bailout fund for countries with liquidity problems.

The value of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) is expected to be increased to about €1 trillion.

European Commission president Jose-Manuel Barroso says he is confident the deal will work.

European Leaders are said to be edging closer to an agreement on how to tackle the Eurozone debt crisis.

A meeting amongst all 27 Eurozone leaders is continuing tonight in Brussels in a desperate attempt to save the euro currency.

It’s understood a deal on  the re-capitalisation of European banks has been done.

They will have to be re-capitalised by next June.

In the first instance, that money is to be raised by private investors.

And if they cannot find it there, national Governments will be asked to stump up the cash.

It is also believed that Eurozone leaders intend to multiply the capacity of their rescue fund  to 1 trillion euro.

There is also speculation that Europe may ask the Chinese Government for some  financial assistance.

The German Chancellor says weaknesses in the euro must be addressed ‘now or never’ ahead of a key EU summit on the Eurozone crisis.

Angela Merkel was speaking as she secured parliamentary support in Germany before the summit.

She referred to the Eurozone challenge as the worst crisis for Europe since the end of World War II.

However hopes are diminishing that European leaders can come up with the answers today.

Draft conclusions leaked ahead of the talks show no deal on a figure for bank recapitalisation.

Diplomats are now warning that further meetings may be necessary later in the week.

The Taoiseach Enda Kenny is attending the summit.

He says he wants major decisions made today but he warned that any such decisions should not mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty.

EU Leaders Strike Deal for Bank Recapitalization by June 2012

Bank recapitalization is but a small part of the total deal.

The purpose of the EU summit was to address a gap in EU finances of approx.

4 Trillion euro.

Last night's agreement only addresses 1.4 Trillion euro.

This is is just another example of German minimalism and incrementalism.

Kicking the can down the road hoping to buy off time.

That's the whole glory of the German plan "we have no idea of what to do, but buying off some time might produce a solution".

The crisis was never nearer and this realization that childern are running the asylum is nowhere comforting.

Dino,

Don’t forget that the Germans DON”T WANT and don’t have much interest in fixing the Greek problem.

Germany is an export nation and if everything is fixed in the EU and there are no worries the markets will stabilize and the Eurocurrency will go out the roof!

If all issues are resolved the Eurocurrency could easily go around $2.00 US and this will hurt the German economy and exports.

BTW particularly on the Greek issue I do think that the Greek economic structure is fundamentally wrong and must be reorganized and restructured.

Which means cutting the government employees, cutting early retirements, cutting hefty government pensions and social spendings etc. And yes never forget the unions;

just ban them with a law!

With few words, an enormous amount of restructuring must be done in order to be able to prosper and compete in the 21st century.

(And that’s NOT only in Greece!)

EU Leaders Strike Deal for Bank Recapitalization by June 2012

George:

You are right and you know we agree on many things.

However, the system reform will take a good decade or so.

As you know the issue here is the severe austerity which happens to be the wrong medicine not only for Europe but the Americas as well.

Ivanko:

Based on your comment, I don't think you realize what is going on. Greece is not getting any free money from no one. These are loans from the ECB.

Every country in the world does the same.

When soveriegn debt loans are up and due for payment, they are replaced by new loans (it's called rollover).

Usually such loans are market loans but Greece has been shut out and thus ECB is taking the place of the private market for such loans.

As to your comment about the Greeks, I disagree.

Not only we can tell you about what is going on (because we are in the eye of the storm) but also how to do it. The fact that our government became overleveraged it does not mean that our experience, education and intellect have disappeared overnight.

And I think it is our democratic duty to tell you what is happenning and your democratic duty to take notes.

Yeah Dino and Greece is BTW the “convenient scapegoat” everybody loves to talk about based on cultural and geopolitical reasons.

Yes Greece does have 160% debt to GDP but how about Ireland, which has whopping 1000% debt to GDP and also Italy with its 120% debt to GDP boiling down to the whopping 2.5 trillion dollars!!! Of course there are others like Spain, Portugal, Belgium etc. but again everybody loves to talk about Greece… which I would mention again happens to be ONLY 2% of the EU GDP.

Anyways it’s worth mentioning that it’s not Germany’s fault that all those countries had bad fiscal discipline and mismanaged their economies.

Therefore the hard working Germans are not obliged to bailout everybody.

Greece is not the biggest problem for Europe.

But if you want to know where they are most corrupt, go to Greece.

If you want to see where people enjoyed the money from government, go to Greece.

Untill today there are 1000's of welpaid jobs where the job is not existing but sstill the workers get paid by government.

There are rules which are absolute crazy, pensions Greece never could afford end and much much more.

If the Greeks want me to believe they never got any advantage from all this loaned money then you are at the wrong door.

If the Greeks tell me they just have loans and didn't get any money then explain me why banks need to take haircut of minimal 50%.

Greeks must not come to me and say they did not want this.

With the Greek version of wir habben das nicht gewust.

You took part in the advantages, you anjoyed them fully and you voted on people who gave you those advantages.

Now crying all days and saying the world how bad they have treated you...

Another thing about the loans you get. Those loans are in fact printed money.

Euro's. When you bring more money in roulation this causes inflation.

Inflation will make people poorer.

This bankrupt states like Greece will make all people in Europe poorer.

Especially the poorest will feel this.

Be proud on that, go tell others on forums what they should do and whio's fault it certainly isn't.

Fack off, deeper haircut for the Greeks please.

Sell some islands and more untill you can pay your debts.

And for the Italians too, and for the Spanish, and for the Belgians and for the French.

Ireland is a complete different case, they are healthy they only had some problems with a property bubble.

October 26, 2011

Across Europe on Wednesday, all eyes are on the EU summit in Brussels, where European leaders are expected to reveal plans to deal with the Eurozone debt crisis.

But each country has different fears and expectations:

In France the worry is the state of the banks and the country's credit rating;

in Italy it's further pressure from the EU on Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to get his financial house in order;

in Germany and other northern European countries, it's the cost of the bailouts, and who is going to pay for them.

ARI SHAPIRO, host:

This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

I'm Ari Shapiro.

RENEE MONTAGNE, host:

And I'm Renee Montagne.

The European Union is facing the worst crisis in its history and it has to the potential to affect us all. The meltdown in Greece could eventually imperil the entire global financial system.

Today in Brussels, Europe's leaders will make another attempt at finalizing a eurozone survival plan.

But time is short and the stakes could not be higher.

The key players have big national issues to worry about.

This morning, we're going to train a spotlight on some of the big nations at the heart of this thing, with the help of NPR's Philip Reeves.

And, Phil, let's shine that spotlight, first, on Italy, which seems to be focus on all the attention in the run-up in this summit.

PHILIP REEVES:

That's right.

And that's because the other day, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was, in effect, given an ultimatum by Germany's Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.

They basically told him to get Italy's finances in order right away, and to report back on his plans to do so ahead of today's summit.

Berlusconi, he doesn't like taking orders from the French and the Germans at all. But he and his coalition partners have been working overnight to hammer out an agreement on austerity and reform plans.

He doesn't have a lot of room to maneuver and his coalition has been weakened by sex scandals and court cases, and is close to collapse.

There's been some big disagreements over these reforms, particularly pensions, but it looks like they've settled that.

But we don't know if he's secured a plan that'll satisfy Merkel and Sarkozy.

They want concrete measures that'll convince the markets, otherwise we're back to the Armageddon scenario.

MONTAGNE:

And you are in Paris.

What is at stake there for the French?

REEVES:

A lot's at stake, and particularly the French banks.

The French-Belgian bank, Dexia, has already toppled, several others have had their credit ratings downgraded.

People are worrying that eurozone contagion will reach here.

The French banks are carrying a lot of Greek and Italian debt.

And the really big worry is that France will loose its triple-A rating.

That will be a huge blow.

It will play havoc with the grand euro survival plan that they're trying to nail down in Brussels today.

It would do President Sarkozy a lot of political damage.

Keeping the Triple-A almost certainly mean more belt tightening.

And there's a big domestic dimension here, too, because there's a presidential election next year.

MONTAGNE:

OK, let's swing our spotlight across the map to the most powerful player of them all - and that would be Germany.

These negotiations are very difficult for Chancellor Angela Merkel, are they not?

REEVES:

Yes. And she really is the biggest player at the table.

I mean Germany is, of course, the economic powerhouse at the heart of Europe.

But Merkel's position is also precarious.

She's widely accused, at home and abroad, of dithering on this.

Germans don't like the idea of writing an open check to rescue, what they see as, profligates southern European nations whose economies are simply not productive or competitive enough.

So she has to tread very carefully and we're seeing her do that today.

Before today's emergency summit kicks off, Merkel is addressing the German Parliament.

Parliament is going to get to vote today on one important part of the grand euro rescue plan, a part concerning boosting the fire power of the eurozone bailout fund.

There are some rebels within Merkel's coalition who oppose anymore bailouts.

And if the vote goes against her, it would be an absolute disaster.

However, all the signs are that she does have enough votes for this to pass.

MONTAGNE:

And then, of course, Phil, history is not just about economic and political equations - no matter how stark they may be. It's also about ambition, rivalry, personal relations between leaders.

All of which, seem to be playing out in this crisis.

REEVES:

Most certainly.

The sound of giant, colliding egos is echoing across Europe right now. I mean let's look at one incident.

At the last summit a couple of days ago, Merkel and Sarkozy gave a press conference and they were asked about Italy's economic reforms.

They exchanged a very loaded glance and smirked, particularly Sarkozy.

Berlusconi was furious.

A pro-Berlusconi Italian paper ran a headline, saying:

To Hell with Sarkozy.

And it urged Italians to go to a laugh-in in front of the French Embassy in Rome.

Now, we all know Italians are fed up with Berlusconi.

But they apparently don't like the idea of Merkel and Sarkozy ganging up on him, especially while those two seem to be getting cozier.

There've been some warm photos of Merkel giving Sarkozy a teddy bear for his newborn daughter.

So it's all pretty Shakespearean stuff.

MONTAGNE:

Phil, thanks very much.

REEVES:

You're welcome.

Wednesday night's E.U. summit in Brussels was at first heralded as the venue for a comprehensive deal that would help Europe's debt crisis â€” then E.U. leaders started ratcheting back the expectations.

MICHELE NORRIS, host:

From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

I'm Michele Norris.

MELISSA BLOCK, host:

And I'm Melissa Block.

European leaders are meeting in Brussels tonight in another attempt to get a grip on Europe's debt crisis.

The issues are complicated.

How much of a loss should European banks be forced to take on the value of Greek bonds?

How big does a bailout fund need to be to convince financial markets the governments of Europe are serious?

The summit is revealing big differences on how to proceed.

NPR's Jim Zarroli is at the European Union headquarters in Brussels and he joins me now. Jim, the effects of this will be felt well beyond Europe, in markets all over the world.

What are European leaders hoping to accomplish at this meeting?

JIM ZARROLI:

Well, this was billed as the final definitive effort to resolve the crisis, you know, which has been crippling Europe's financial markets for a long time now. The problem, of course, is there have been a lot of summits.

There have been a lot of, you know, lots of talk of action plans.

They haven't really succeeded so far. But this time, this was an effort to try to show some real resolve on the issue.

Here was Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou arriving at the E.U. this morning.

Prime Minister GEORGE PAPANDREOU:

Now, is the time for the European leadership collectively to take decisions to end the uncertainty, end the crisis, turn the page and make sure we make a big step forward for the better future and prosperity and security of our peoples in Europe.

BLOCK:

So, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou there talking about turning the page.

To do that, Jim, what measures are being considered this time around?

ZARROLI:

Well, there are a lot of things being talked about and a lot of details still being worked out. For instance, there's been talk about raising the capital requirements for big European banks to 9 percent.

In very simple terms, that means they - basically, they'd have to set aside more money against the riskier assets.

It's supposed to be kind of a confidence-building gesture for the financial markets.

The problem there is that European banks tend to be undercapitalized, especially compared to U.S. banks. So, it would be a challenge for them to raise the additional capital.

And they're supposed to do it by next June.

At the same time, European leaders are saying that they don't want the banks to be leveraged too much.

In other words, you know, don't try to sell off too many assets to raise the money.

So, it's kind of unclear, at this point, how they would meet the targets.

BLOCK:

Now, Jim, before the E.U. Summit today the German parliament voted on some of the outlines of a bailout.

Germany is key to the recovery effort.

What did the German parliament decide?

ZARROLI:

Well, the important thing they decided, I think, was to increase the size of the stabilization fund that has been set up to rescue the big European banks.

Right now, it's about 440 billion euros, which I think is 600-odd billion dollars.

Half of that is said to be pledged already.

There are a lot of people who say it's not enough.

They say it needs to be a trillion euros or more.

The Germans basically agreed to expand the fund.

But once again, they didn't put any numbers on it, no details.

The Germans and other European leaders want to extract some promises in exchange for increasing the fund.

For instance, they want a promise from some of the holders of Greek bonds that they will take a bigger loss on the bonds than they've been willing to do so far. So, there's no agreement on that score.

There's also - right now, there's a lot of pressure on the Italian government to accept some austerity measures and it's not clear whether it will do so.

BLOCK:

So, Jim, a lot of focus on Greek debt, how much of a haircut investors will have to take.

Also now, a lot of concern about Italy's debt.

Why are people so concerned about that?

ZARROLI:

Well, Italy has a lot of debt.

Its debt is equal to about 120 percent of its gross domestic product.

Now, much of that is internal debt, which means it's held by people inside the country, which is usually considered less risky.

The problem is that investors are growing more nervous about Italy.

It's having to pay more to borrow money.

That's not at Greek levels yet, but it's seeing it's interest rates go up. And that's a problem for its banks, because Italian banks are very big holders of government debt.

So, if the Italian government can't pay what it owes, it would, you know, hurt the banks.

It would cause a ripple effect through the financial system.

That would really affect all of Europe.

Now, Italian President Silvio Berlusconi is under pressure to impose some austerity measures.

It's very politically contentious right now. There was actually a scuffle on the floor of the parliament today.

Berlusconi is actually threatening to resign, you know.

But the upside is everything really is just still up in the air. And it seems unlikely that anything definitive and comprehensive is going to come out of this meeting.

BLOCK:

OK. NPR's Jim Zarroli speaking with us from European Union headquarters in Brussels.

Jim, thanks a lot.

ZARROLI:

You're welcome.

October 27, 2011

European leaders met through the night in Brussels and finally  emerged  Thursday with a debt deal they say is wide-ranging.

They're hopeful it will  guide the continent out of the widening  debt crisis that started with  Greece.

But it's unclear whether they have  the political will and  economic flexibility to implement it.

As talks began Wednesday in the Belgian capital â€”  the second EU meeting in four days â€” Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said the summit was about not just saving the euro currency but also safeguarding the ideals at the core of a united Europe:

"Peace and cooperation amongst our nations, social cohesion and solidarity without prejudice amongst our people."

After some eight hours of talks that ended around 4 a.m. local time, eurozone leaders said they had secured an agreement for banks to take a voluntary 50 percent loss on Greek bonds.

The plan aims to reduce Greek debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020, from its current 160 percent.

The officials also said they would boost the power of the euro area's bailout fund to around $1 trillion by offering insurance to debt buyers, or through a special fund to be set up to attract investment from China, Brazil and elsewhere.

Building Safeguards Against Default

European Council President Herman Van Rompuy conceded that key details on implementing that part of the plan remain to be worked out. "It is not easy to explain, but we are going to do more with our available money. ... Banks have been doing this for centuries," he added.

There was also agreement to make European banks significantly boost their capital reserves by the end of June to better protect them from possible government debt defaults.

In July, banks agreed to take a 21 percent loss and fiercely resisted a deeper cut.

But in a statement Thursday morning, the head of the group representing big banks called the deal a "comprehensive package" to stabilize Europe.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the plans should reassure the world about the future of the eurozone.

"I believe we were able to live up to expectations, that we did the right thing for the eurozone," Merkel said, "and this brings us one step further along the road to more stability and a stable union."

Leaders also announced plans to improve economic governance of the eurozone.

European heads of state were under pressure from the markets and world capitals to forge a deal ahead of a key meeting of the Group of 20 in France early next month.

'Already Too Late'?

Sony Kapoor, the director of the economic think tank Re-Define, says eurozone leaders are finally tackling the heart of the debt crisis, and their solutions are pointing in the right direction.

But he says eurozone leaders have wasted too much time.

It's already too late, he says, for the several million Europeans who have lost their jobs, and too late for the eurozone economies that are slipping into recession.

Kapoor says the financial world is right to be skeptical that the leaders can expeditiously implement yet another rescue plan.

"It is going to take a massive, gargantuan, unprecedented effort of political will that we have so far not seen from our leaders," he said.

"They have been parochial, they have been petty, they have procrastinated.

And they're going to have to get their act together.

Otherwise, this is already too late."

On Italy â€” Europe's third largest economy â€” eurozone leaders put enormous pressure on Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to make good on specific reform plans, including big changes to government pension plans and pledges to boost the retirement age. It's not at all clear that Berlusconi's weak ruling coalition can deliver on those promises.

The European Commission's president, Jose Manuel Barroso, said Thursday morning that now it's time for Italy to deliver.

"The key is implementation," Barroso said.

"This is the key. It is not enough to make commitments.

It is necessary now to check if they are really implemented."

Barroso may as well have been speaking about the entire new plan to rescue the euro.

Banks To Take 50pct Cut On Greek Debt

BRUSSELS October 26, 2011, 09:28 pm ET

BRUSSELS (AP) â€” A European Union official says the currency union's leaders have reached a deal with banks to take losses of 50 percent of their Greek bonds in a key move to solve the eurozone's debt crisis.

The official was speaking early Thursday morning on condition of anonymity pending an official statement.

A second official confirmed that there was a voluntary deal.

 

EU debt deal may be near

European banks agreed early this morning to accept losses of 50 percent on their Greek bonds, a European Union official said, removing the last apparent roadblock to a broad plan to solve the continent’s debt crisis.

The deal would significantly cut Greece’s debt load, the problem that started the euro zone’s debt drama almost two years ago.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy estimated the euro region’s bailout fund will be worth $1.4 trillion after European governments agreed on steps to leverage existing guarantees by as much as five times.

The fund will help protect larger economies such as Italy and Spain from market pressures that combined to pushed Greece to need a rescue.

Sarkozy spoke to reporters after a summit of European leaders in Brussels.

Banks reach agreement on Greek debt after EU crunch talks

Last Updated:

10:15 PM, October 26, 2011

BRUSSELS -- The eurozone sealed a grand deal to overcome its festering debt crisis early Thursday when banks agreed to take a 50 percent loss on Greek debt, an EU diplomat said.

"There is a deal," the source said following tough talks in Brussels between leaders of the eurozone and the Institute of International Finance (IIF) banking lobby to force the private sector to share the pain of Greece's debt burden.

Officials from the troubled eurozone have been negotiating the size of a "haircut," or write-down, to be taken by banks holding some €210 billion (US$292 billion) of Greek debt.

IIF head Charles Dallara earlier met French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the sidelines of a summit of the 17-nation euro area.

Convincing banks to erase billions in Greek debt was a key part of the grand deal leaders pledged to deliver at the summit, along with a bank recapitalization plan and a beefed-up rescue fund to soothe fears of a global recession.

The banks had agreed to take a 21 percent "haircut" on the Greek bondholdings as part of a second bailout for Athens agreed at a July summit, but the economic situation has deteriorated since then.

The 50 percent "haircut" will slice off €100 billion from Greece's €350 billion debt.

EU Leaders Meet to Tackle Debt Crisis

By:

News Desk

German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks at the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, in Berlin on Wednesday.

12:30 p.m. ET | Germany's parliament has passed Merkel's measure, boosting a bailout fund for the eurozone as leaders arrive in Brussels for the start of the summit.

Original post:

| European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels Wednesday in an attempt to reach a deal to expand aid for debt-laden countries in the eurozone amid fears that Greece's debt woes will spread.

A Greek default could have spillover consequences in other European countries and the global economy, a risk U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has characterized as "catastrophic."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is pushing a measure in the legislature that would bolster the fund, a move she said is critical to maintaining Germany's own economic growth.

"The world is watching Europe and Germany;

it is watching whether we are ready and able, in the hour of Europe's most serious crisis since the end of World War II, to take responsibility," Merkel said to parliament.

Proposals being considered include adding to the EU bailout fund, preparing banks to compensate for losses and trying to stave off growing debt or default within troubled nations.

(The Wall Street Journal has a live blog with up-to-the-minute developments from the euro zone meeting.)

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is also expected to provide an economic plan that would address his country's mounting debt.

The meeting is overshadowed by concerns that European leaders may not be able to reach a substantive agreement in time to avoid a default.

The New York Times recaps :

"On several previous occasions, European leaders have promised systemic changes to resolve the euro's troubles, only to come up with a patchwork that fails to mollify the markets and just delays the day of reckoning.

From all appearances this week, this could be another disappointment, an agreement on a general plan but without many specifics, and probably without the massive 'wall of money' to protect vulnerable Italy and Spain that the markets have demanded."

After providing bailouts for Portugal, Ireland and Greece, there is concern about having the resources to put together bailouts for larger economies like Italy and Spain .

Sarkozy and Cameron.

As European stock markets slump ahead of Wednesday's European Union summit, new fears of a euro zone recession abound.

Coming to an agreement on actions to deal with this crisis has set some of the EU's largest countries against each other.

Frustrations have led to personal criticisms this week as French President Nicolas Sarkozy's criticisms of British Prime Minister David Cameron for his remarks on the euro zone debt crisis.

Despite these remarks, it is important that the non-euro zone EU countries attend the debt crisis talks.

The EU has historically had trouble finding the balance between governing an economic and political union and respecting the sovereignty of individual nations.

Such issues have come to a head during the debt crisis and recession talks — after a Franco-German meeting with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to force a quicker economic overhaul in Italy, Berlusconi fought back with a strong statement this week, arguing against EU administrators having more power than elected national government officials.

This statement effectively constructs a barrier between European Union economic policy and Italy’s economic reforms and complicates the euro zone’s bailout measures.

Despite uniting against Italy, both France and Germany do not agree on the extent of the euro zone bailout funded by core members — in large part themselves — for weaker nations, such as Greece and Portugal.

France's own weakening economy in the last few months has increased investor fears that the bailout fund will not be strong enough to do the job. This has led to a French concession in the debt crisis negotiations — they are no longer fighting for an enlarged bailout fund.

Germany remains the euro zone’s economic powerhouse, which gives it political power going into the EU meeting, but how long will it avoid recession?

Germany has been kept afloat by a rise in the service sector, but in recent months, both manufacturing and exports have fallen. 

It is within this climate of economic uncertainty and political conflict in the euro zone that will undoubtedly have large impacts on the entire EU, not to mention international finance, that Sarkozy rebuked Cameron for criticizing their handling of the euro zone debt crisis, this despite Britain not being on the euro.

While non-euro zone EU members should stay out of the currencies macroeconomic policy normally, such comments are not helpful on the eve of a large-scale crisis.

Non-euro zone EU members have a right to attend large euro zone economic meetings that will impact their own economies despite being on a different currency.

Such meetings should have structured agendas to keep non-euro zones interests from becoming the priority, but without the buy-in of the non-euro zone members it may be difficult for the euro zone to go ahead with its bailout plans , which include a scheme to encourage foreign investment to support the euro zone bailout.

Such a scheme would also be open to the United States and China, but as close neighbors to the euro zone and EU members, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and other large non-euro zone nations have great incentive to support the scheme as well.

Sarkozy's remarks did not garner much support as it was finally decided that in addition to the 17 euro zone nations, 10 non-euro zone EU countries will attend today's meeting.

European leaders, euro zone or otherwise, need to come together to support action to mitigate the impact of the debt crisis and looming recession on the European economy.

This will require walking the shaky line between EU institutions and national constituencies, as Cameron has already discovered , but without wide cooperation and agreement to today's plan, Europe may once again succumb to recession.

Europe's politicians would like to celebrate the decisions of the 26 October summit as historic.

But the euro crisis will be with us a while longer yet. The basic paradox – that states want to buy the trust of investors with money that they don’t have – just can’t be eternally ignored.

Stephan Kaufmann

Anyone who has grown fond of the euro crisis has little to worry about:

it’ll be around a while yet. Even the decisions of the latest EU summit won’t  see it off. On one hand, those who blame the politicians for the crisis  are right.

On the other, they’re sparing themselves the insight that  the politicians are grappling with a gigantic real-world contradiction,  which springs out of the logic of the system itself and can’t be so  easily shoved away.

The  starting point is the finding that the eurozone states are carrying too  much debt.

This is the verdict passed down by the states’ creditors,  the financial markets, in line with their unvarying criteria on  investments:

safety and return.

The  states have borrowed too much, but you can flip that around and say  that the financial markets have loaned out too much.

This isn’t to fling  the blame for the misery onto the investors, but just to point out the  underlying problem:

the debts of the states are the assets of banks,  insurance companies and funds.

The  financial wealth of the world consists in large part of government  promises to pay, and it’s the validity of those promises that is now  being questioned.

What this actually means is that the financial markets  have raked in way too much sovereign debt.

In short, they have too much  capital on their hands – far too much to still be able to turn it into  spendable cash.

Nuclear option

Such  situations are common in capitalism.

Industry also regularly turns out  goods it can’t sell.

The solution to this problem remains the same:

devaluation, which leads to goods and factories being sold off or  destroyed.

In the current crisis, though, it’s precisely this  devaluation that must be avoided, for a large-scale write-down of  financial capital would – the fear is – tip states and banks into the  abyss.

"Contagion" is the name of the threat that will be hovering over  us for as long as the financial markets fear it.

To  calm the markets, the politicians are moving on in quickstep to another  solution.

On the one hand, they’re pushing radical austerity programs  onto countries to bring them back to health as viable investment spheres  and to make the accumulated national debt mountain solid again.

They’re  doing this to assure doubtful lenders that their investments are  guaranteed – yet the guarantors are precisely those whose  creditworthiness is being doubted.

And so with money that they don’t  have, governments are supposed to rescue states, prop up the banks and  buy back the lost confidence in their financial clout.

This  contradiction has been playing out for months now. The crisis of  confidence is turning into a never-ending cycle that could probably only  be broken in the short term if the European Central Bank were to step  up as guarantor.

For only the ECB can, in theory, hand out unlimited  sums.

The refusal of Germany in particular to let the ECB take on this  role comes from the hope that the crisis can be tamed without this “nuclear option”.

Eurozone is not out of danger

And  so tougher cuts, debt forgiveness for Greece, boosted capital reserves  for banks and a bigger EFSF are supposed to take on the task of bringing  back confidence in the creditworthiness of Europe.

Whether it works out  quite like that is iffy.

Each of these steps is likely to stoke the  mistrust even more.

Because  with the slashing of the debt, politicians are revising their former  position that the radical austerity programmes were actually working.

The recapitalisation of the banks contradicts their former assurance  that the banking system was robust enough.

By  authorising the EFSF to support the banks, they’re giving up their  claim that this recapitalisation was enough to ringfence the banks  against the crisis.

 By making the EFSF bigger, they’re scrapping their  verdict that the crisis was merely a problem of a few small states that  didn’t know how to keep their books in order.

By  leveraging the EFSF to ever higher sums in the billions, they’re  disproving their claim that the eurozone is finally out of danger.

And  with the ongoing fight over the cost of the euro rescue, with worries  about euro-bonds and any stronger involvement by the ECB, with the tight  restrictions on relief measures – in short, with the constantly  stressed conditions they’re slapping on the bailout, they’re  contradicting their own claim to do everything possible, and with no  strings attached, to save the euro.

Translated from the German by Anton Baer

From Brussels

S.O.S. to a reluctant China

La Libre Belgique sees a “shadow” looming up “over the eurozone.” Among the solutions to the crisis worked out on the night of October 26 to 27, the seventeen members of the eurozone have decided to jump up the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to 1,000 billion euros, a figure below market expectations.

Leaders also agreed to bolster the EFSF with a special fund backed by the IMF that will welcome buy-ins from emerging countries like China and Russia.

“The  eurozone has now publicly admitted its inability to cope by itself,” writes the Belgian daily in its editorial:

The S.O.S. sent out by  Europe to the emerging powers is a development that would have been  unthinkable a few years back.

It reflects the changes in the power  relations between major world powers, but more so the depth of the  current lack of confidence on the Old Continent in the ability of the  European project, plagued by divisions, to overcome this crisis and to  dare to take a further step towards greater integration and solidarity.

Europe must rediscover a grand ‘political’ design.

And fast.

Because  fear is often a bad counsellor, and we must never forget that.

The leaders of the Eurozone have reduced Greece’s debt and increased the amount of EU aid. However, for Eleftherotypia, which notes on its front page that “German tanks are in the bailout,” the decision will put the Greeks and all Europeans under the heel of Berlin.

Buoyed  by a Bundestag vote in which she secured the support of 80% of  Germany’s MPs, Angela Merkel went on to attend the Brussels summit to  find a solution to the Greek problem.

However,  the decision taken by the summit had already been announced, almost  point by point, by the Chancellor before the German parliament.

Apparently, she did not even take into account the views expressed by  other European leaders.

It is as though there were no other players in  Europe.

Of  course, everyone knows that Germany is the strongest player.

Everyone  knows that its opinion has more weight than the others.

But it cannot  always have the last word.

Because in politics, you cannot apply the  same rules as in football:

otherwise we will arrive at a situation where “in the end, Germany always wins,” as one former English footballer put  it.

Merkel does as she pleases

The  way things are going now, politics and football have switched sides in  this dichotomy:

because in football, Germany often loses, whereas in  Europe, they always succeed in imposing their opinion.

And in so doing,  they have not met with any opposition.

Even  the French president has been roundly criticised by his national press  for supporting the German position.

Other leaders, like Luxembourg’s  Prime Minster Jean Claude Juncker, have voiced concern over Germany’s  hegemony.

However,  none of this has served any purpose.

Chancellor Merkel does as she  pleases.

With regard to Greece, she has imposed a solution that entails a  50% devaluation of sovereign debt, and far-reaching structural reforms  including a number of key austerity measures.

No positive future

This  is what has been exchanged for the gift of restructuring.

Even if  Merkel says that she has “respect” for the sacrifices accepted by the  Greeks, it will not change the reality of austerity for Greece, or other  countries that are in now trouble – and these include Italy, even if  Berlusconi has been shy to admit it.

Greece,  like every other country in the eurozone, is now at the mercy of  Germany.

When major decisions are under discussion, and, at the end of  the day, they are imposed by a single country that is determined not to  give in no matter what the consequences, the others are necessarily  obliged to back down.

If  the situation continues with no other country being allowed to express  its point of view, there will be no positive future in Europe especially  for small countries, which are the weak links in the chain.

Zero hour for the euro has come

26 October 2011

The extraordinary summit held in Brussels on October 26 is considered crucial by the European press.

But whether it's about rescuing Greece or saving the single currency itself, it's a sense of unease that dominates.

This October 26 is “€-day for Europe”, headlines De Morgen , which asks “Will European leaders succeed in saving the euro?” An unconvinced Yves Desmet, political editor of the Flemish daily, expects -

... another crucial day when the countries in the eurozone – so says president Herman van Rompuy – will take up a bazooka to, yet again, force the markets to toe the line.

For now, it seems they're only going to reuse the recipe that has already been served up:

a little more debt relief for Greece, a little more capital for the banks, billions more for the rescue fund.

So far, this has left the markets unmoved.

The bazooka is starting to look more like a water pistol.

For La Vanguardia , “The euro's future is at stake” in complex discussions “at an uncertain summit”.

The agreement on the euro is -

... like a matrushka doll, which inside the largest contains many smaller ones.

If the smaller dolls do not fit in perfectly, the bigger dolls cannot be snapped shut.

The agreement to boost the financial stabilisation funds is tightly related to the 'haircut' of 50 percent on Greece's sovereign debt, the recapitalisation of banks and the commitments by all the member states to take steps to stimulate the economy.

For without growth, neither austerity nor the firepower of the fund will get us out of the crisis.

However, for Manel Pérez , the editor of the Barcelona daily, the seventeen members of the eurozone will have to choose “between what is unjust and what is inexpedient.”

... If, to calm down the Germans, we choose financial engineering, through insurance or debt mechanisms that will let us boast of having resources without actually putting them on the table, this won't let us protect the debt of countries in difficulties and will increase the size of the debt that cannot be paid off. [...] For this reason, the obsessive fear of inflation of the Germans, who are restraining the ECB from getting involved in resolving the crisis, is worrying its partners in the eurozone.

Keynes said, 'Inflation is unjust and deflation inexpedient', but of the two perhaps deflation is worse, 'because it is worse, in an impoverished world, to provoke unemployment than to disappoint the rentier.'

In fact, notes To Ethnos , the summit opens in a “euro-vertigo over the veto of Merkel.” For the Greek daily -

The situation in Brussels is explosive.

Everything hangs on the position of Germany and Angela Merkel, who is building a wall between Germany and the other Europeans.

To the chagrin of the banks, a haircut of 50 percent on Greece's debt is in the offing, while the IMF would raise that to 60 percent and banks are claiming they would be dealt a staggering blow by any write-down beyond 40 percent.

Specifically, the Chancellor would prefer to pay the banks… All this against a tense backdrop of an indifferent Italy and Greece pushed to the brink if this collapse is not sandbagged as it should be.

In Germany, Handelsblatt denounces “the day of broken promises“ in advance.

The business daily regrets that the EU leaders' commitments to the voters, investors and banks are about to be disowned:

The summit has not even started, yet the final statement has already been drafted.

For it is more important to the heads of state and government to salvage their reputations than to save the single currency.

That's why the Seventeen have already praised the achievements that they are about to pull off:

'The agreement reached today represents another significant step forward.

The euro still rests on a solid foundation,' reads a draft of the final declaration.

In truth, the foundations of the euro have been undermined by a half-dozen broken promises.

[...] Debt will be restructured, the rescue funds pumped up to super-size...”

In the end, observes Le Figaro , it will a new Europe led by Germany that will emerge from the summit:

If we have to choose between the Germany of Merkel and the Italy of Berlusconi, we won't hesitate.

Those who denounce an alleged axis between Paris and Berlin have not grasped the gravity of the crisis.

(...) German primacy is a given in the new architecture that is emerging.

And that primacy should encourage us to be ambitious in our plans to rebuild Europe, but hand in hand with Germany.

EU leaders meet over debt crisis

Wed Oct 26, 2011 2:10PM

Share | Email | Print

German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L), Director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde (C) and President of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet.

European Union leaders are gathering for an emergency summit for the second time this week, in hopes of finalizing a plan to tackle the eurozone debt crisis.

EU and eurozone leaders will meet in Brussels on Wednesday in a bid to find a solution to what is seen as the worst economic crisis in Europe's history, The Washington Post reported.

Two European officials said on condition of anonymity that the 17 EU members have failed to reach an agreement on the details of two key elements of the plan, which is reducing Greece's massive debts and boosting the EU bailout fund.

Just hours before the meeting, the European Commission urged eurozone leaders to deliver a "credible" response to the debt crisis.

"We need a deal tonight. ... We expect a credible political answer to key questions on the table," AFP quoted European Commission spokesman, Olivier Bailly as saying.

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel called on the EU private sector to make bigger contributions to reduce Greece's debt burden, as she fought for the support of German lawmakers ahead of the make-or-break summit to tackle the euro's debt crisis.

Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi has also been under heavy pressure from his European colleagues to take concrete action on Italy's huge public debt and kick start growth in the country.

Berlusconi promised his eurozone partners to offer a detailed plan of the measures his government will take to boost growth and reduce debt before the Wednesday summit

However, spokeswoman Bailly said Tuesday afternoon that European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso had yet to receive the letter outlining Italy's plans.

There is a growing fear among EU leaders that Italy could be sucked into a crisis that has already claimed Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

The EU is going to recapitalize its biggest banks to prevent a deepening of the debt crisis.

The agreement came at a Brussels summit of the EU heads of state and government.

Leaders warned that this bank stabilization is a one-time measure.

The agreement requires banks to obtain 9 percent of the highest quality capital by June next year.

Under the deal, banks should first look to private sources for that capital before relying on national governments.

As a last resort, they would get a loan from the EU's bailout fund.

PSI - or public sector involvement in the second Greek bailout - is one of the key issues the leaders once again failed to agree on. Private sector involvement means that banks exposed to Greek debt would have to take losses.

Some, like Germany, the EU's biggest economy, are calling for a debt write-down of 60 percent to alleviate the burden on European taxpayers.

Economists explain that this reduction of Greek debt is a form of default.

This, experts say, is the scenario when the crisis would spill over to the other 16 countries that use the euro currency.

At the summit, the leaders also failed to strike a deal on how to beef up the EU's communal fund for bailing out troubled countries.

Just like the 2008 U.S. meltdown affected the entire world, the problems of Europe have global implications.

America, for example, has grown increasingly concerned.

Eurozone bail-out mechanism now €1tn

27 October 2011

By Daniel Mason

European Union leaders last night reached agreement on what they described as a "comprehensive set of additional measures" to tackle the sovereign debt crisis and stabilise the banking system – which include private creditors taking a 50 per cent haircut on Greek debt.

Following a 10-hour emergency summit in Brussels yesterday, leaders agreed to boost the eurozone bail-out mechanism from €440bn to €1tn.

As well as accepting a 50 per cent loss on their holdings of Greek debt, banks will have to recapitalise to the tune of about €106bn by next summer.

Greece will receive a further €100bn in assistance from the EU and the International Monetary Fund from the beginning of next year.

Banks had been unwilling to accept losses on Greek debt of more than 40 per cent.

But a last-minute agreement was brokered for Greek bonds to be swapped for new loans.

Two methods of leveraging the European Financial Stability Facility to €1tn – as a firewall to prevent the spread of debt contagion – were endorsed.

The first is to give credit enhancement to sovereign bonds issued by member states.

The second involved in the creation of a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle to attract investment from the IMF and economies such as China.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy will meet Chinese premier Hu Jintao today as part of preparations for a G20 meeting on 3 November.

President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso said:

"The package that we have agreed tonight, a comprehensive package, confirms that Europe will do what it takes to safeguard financial stability.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, this is a marathon not a sprint."

President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy, who chaired the meeting, remarked:

"We do not want to repeat some of the errors from the recent past.

In taking today's decisions, we lay the foundations for our future.

All members of the Euro Summit are determined to follow this path."

Sarkozy described the deal as "credible" and "ambitious" while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said leaders had "done what needed doing".

Greece's Prime Minister George Papandreou said:

"We can claim that a new day has come for Greece, and not only for Greece but also for Europe."

Leaders also welcomed Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's commitment to balance his country's budget by 2013 and reduce its debt burden to 113 per cent of GDP by 2014.

Banks agree 50 per cent loss on Greek debt

by Daniel Mason

27 October 2011

European Union leaders early this morning reached agreement on what they described as a "comprehensive set of additional measures" to tackle the sovereign debt crisis and stabilise the banking system – including asking private creditors to take a 50 per cent haircut on Greek debt.

Following a 10 hour emergency summit in Brussels, which dragged into the early hours of this morning, leaders agreed to boost the eurozone bail-out mechanism from €440bn to €1tn.

On top of accepting a 50 per cent loss on their holdings of Greek debt, banks will have to recapitalise to the tune of about €106bn by next summer.

And Greece will receive a further €100bn in assistance from the EU and International Monetary Fund from the beginning of next year – as well as a €30bn contribution to ease private sector losses.

The deal had appeared under threat last night when the managing director of the Institute for International finance, Charles Dallara, released a statement saying there was "no agreement on any element of the deal".

Banks had been unwilling to accept losses on Greek debt of more than 40 per cent, but a last minute agreement was brokered for Greek bonds to be swapped for new loans.

Under the plan for recapitalisation banks will have to bring the level of their highest quality capital to 9 per cent by June next year.

Banks' payments of bonuses and dividends will be "constrained" until the target is reached, EU leaders said.

Two methods of leveraging the European Financial Stability Facility – which has about €250bn left following bail-outs of Greece, Portugal and Ireland – were endorsed to increase the amount available to €1tn without extra guarantees.

The first is to give credit enhancement to sovereign bonds issued by member states.

The second involved in the creation of a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle to attract investment from the IMD and economies such as China which have expressed an interest.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy will meet Chinese premier Hu Jintao today as part of preparations for a G20 meeting on 3 November.

The euro rose to a seven-week high against the dollar following the conclusion of the summit, and this morning stock markets were up across Europe – suggesting that the deal had at least bought some time.

President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso said:

"The package that we have agreed tonight, a comprehensive package, confirms that Europe will do what it takes to safeguard financial stability.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, this is a marathon not a sprint."

He added that technical work to finalise the details of the deal's complexities would be completed in the coming weeks.

In a 15-page summit communiqué EU presidents and prime ministers said they agreed on a "comprehensive set of additional measures reflecting out strong determination to do whatever is required to overcome the present difficulties and take the necessary steps for the completion of our economic and monetary union".

Afterwards President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy, who chaired the meeting, remarked:

"We do not want to repeat some of the errors of the recent past.

In taking today's decisions, we lay the foundations for our future.

All members of the Euro Summit are determined to follow this path."

Sarkozy described the deal as "credible" and "ambitious" while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said leaders had "done what needed doing".

Meanwhile Greece will see its debt reduced from a projected peak of 186 per cent of gross domestic product to 120 per cent by 2020, and Prime Minister George Papandreou said:

"We can claim that a new day has come for Greece, and not only for Greece but also for Europe."

But that new era will include some loss of sovereignty after Germany insisted that an economic supervisory group be based in Greece for the duration of the assistance programme in addition to the regular visits of the troika.

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's expressed commitment to balance his country's budget by 2013 and reduce its debt burden to 113 per cent of GDP by 2014 was welcomed at the summit.

Berlusconi, who has been the focus of the debt crisis in recent days, has been under intense pressure to implement further austerity measures and structural changes, including pension reform, to pull Italy back from the brink of economic collapse.

Spain, meanwhile, was praised for the progress it has made on reducing its deficit.

The ECB, which began purchasing Spanish and Italian bonds in August to bring down government borrowing costs, is expected to continue to purchase bonds on the secondary market.

Van Rompuy, Barroso and President of the Eurogroup Jean-Claude Juncker were asked to look into way that economic integration in the eurozone could be advanced – including through limited treaty changes.

They will present their initial findings in December and publish a report in March 2012.

Leaders reiterated their commitment to the single currency:

"The euro is at the core of our European project.

We will strengthen the economic union to make it commensurate with the monetary union."

The communiqué set out 10 measures to boost economic coordination, including holding Euro Summits twice a year.

And British Prime Minister David Cameron has advocated a non-euro group to ensure the voices of member states outside the eurozone are heard.

Reactions from the European Parliament were mixed.

President Jerzy Buzek said the deal inspired hope that the crisis would be contained, but said the EU needed to "pursue vigorously a pro-growth agenda" alongside austerity.

Likewise Joseph Daul, chairman of the centre-right European People's Party said much more needed to be done, "in particular adopting a new model of economic governance, without which the euro cannot operate sustainably".

And the creation of a European Monetary Fund and a single European bond market remain on the wish list of Alliance of Liberal and Democrats leader Guy Verhofstadt despite his relief that "after two years of delay and hesitation EU leaders finally realised their backs were against the wall".

The European Conservatives and Reformists were more critical, suggesting that EU leaders had merely "rearranged the deck chairs on the Titanic".

Leader Jan Zahradil said:

"A vast amount of both private and public funds will be poured into the debt bail out. Other debts will simply be written off and a bond union will be created.

We are at the beginning of massive fiscal transfers that we have never seen before in our history," adding that the consequences would political and social as well as economic.

Meanwhile co-presidents of the Green/European Free Alliance Dany Cohn-Bendit and Rebecca Harms said the agreement did not provide a definitive answer, lacked clarity and amounted to "ad-hoc firefighting".

If similar decision had been made a year ago "we wouldn't be in this position today," said Socialists and Democrats leader Martin Schulz.

And there was a further note of caution from Liberal Democrat Sharon Bowles, who chairs the parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee.

She warned that both options for leveraging the EFSF were "giant experiments and not without risk".

She said:

"The insurance option has some similarity to mortgage and United States department guarantees, whilst the SPV option has similarities with structured products.

Despite popular sentiment going against such financial engineering, some such mechanisms have performed well through the recession, so they should not be discounted."

The deal to expand the EFSF was still vague, according to Professor Philip Booth of Cass Business School.

"It is possible that huge upfront guarantees by EU governments have been avoided but only at the expense of loading even bigger burdens onto EU governments should there be a default in the future.

This is a high-risk strategy for the EU member states.

If Italy undergoes radical reform to raise its growth rate, the eurozone might just contain this crisis to Greece.

However, if Italy does not undertake reform, the crisis will simply get worse."

BERLIN | Tue Oct 25, 2011 8:23am EDT

BERLIN Oct 25 (Reuters) - Germany opposes a phrase in a draft conclusion for Wednesday's EU summit that calls for the European Central Bank to continue buying bonds in the secondary market, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday, sending the euro lower.

"This sentence is not agreed with us," she told reporters, adding that Germany did not want a declaration from politicians telling the ECB what to do.

Merkel left the question open of whether the ECB would itself make a statement on the issue.

According to a draft obtained by Reuters, euro zone leaders will call on the ECB to continue with its "non-standard measures in current exceptional circumstances", a phrase that EU sources said referred to the ECB's purchase of the bonds from countries like Italy and Spain.

* German parliament to vote on EFSF leverage around 1200 GMT

* Rebel MPs from Merkel's own coalition seen defying her

* Merkel still likely to pass bill without relying on opposition

By Sarah Marsh

BERLIN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angel Merkel looks set to win a parliamentary vote on Wednesday on boosting the firepower of the euro zone rescue fund with a large majority, bolstering her negotiating strength ahead of a crunch EU summit.

Merkel needs to win the vote in the Bundestag lower house of parliament, due around 1200 GMT, to have a mandate to negotiate a deal with other EU leaders aimed at delivering a range of measures to stop the euro zone debt crisis spiralling.

The bill will almost certainly pass as the government has agreed a joint motion on the plans with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens.

The question is whether Merkel, who still faces a rebellion from within her own centre-right coalition, can pass it without having to rely on the opposition, which would be a severe blow.

A test run held on Tuesday showed she is likely to win the vote without needing opposition support -- but only just.

In the ballot, a total of 16 lawmakers from Merkel's coalition parties either voted against or abstained.

The proposals, to increase the efficiency of the 440 billion euro ($610 billion) fund without pouring more taxpayers' money into it, are the subject of fierce debate in Europe's largest economy and biggest contributor to the fund.

Merkel is battling sliding ratings for herself and her centre-right coalition over her handling of the euro zone crisis.

Critics at home and abroad have accused her of taking a dithering approach that has exacerbated the debt crisis.

Merkel's hands have been tied in her negotiations on the euro zone crisis since a Constitutional Court ruling last month demanded a greater say for German lawmakers on bailout issues.

That ruling has frustrated some EU leaders eager to implement quick solutions.

Even after the summit, Germany's parliament budget committee must meet to discuss the outcome.

On Monday, her conservatives unexpectedly announced the Bundestag lower house would hold a full vote on the new guidelines on the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).

Analysts say Merkel wants to have a large parliamentary majority to gain legitimacy in negotiating for Germany.

The chancellor will hold a speech on the motion around 1000 GMT, with a parliamentary debate following.

Just a month ago, Merkel struggled to contain a rebellion from within her own centre-right coalition in a parliamentary vote on the EFSF.

She was only five votes short of having to rely on opposition support which would have been a major blow, possibly even triggering early elections.

Some rebels who fear the crisis is spiralling out of control are gearing up once again to defy Merkel.

An EU paper, obtained by Reuters, shows two options for increasing the fund's firepower -- an insurance model and a special purpose investment vehicle (SPIV) .

Investors hope leaders will on Wednesday decide which of the two approaches should be used, or a combination.

The summit is expected to run late into the night.

Merkel said on Tuesday Germany opposed a phrase in the draft summit conclusions urging the ECB to go on buying troubled states' bonds.

The draft seen by Reuters supports a continuation of "non-standard measures in the current exceptional financial market environment".

"This sentence is not agreed with us," Merkel told reporters, adding that Germany -- a country wedded to central bank independence -- did not want a declaration from politicians telling the ECB what to do.

An opposition lawmaker said the German parliament would try to point the ECB in the opposite direction, noting a joint motion between the government and main opposition parties contained the expectation that the ECB would stop its bond purchases on the secondary market.

Wed Oct 26, 2011 7:36pm EDT

* Draft statement talks of leveraging bailout fund "several fold"

* Says details to be decided in November

* EU source says leaders looking to Greek debt writedown in excess of 50%

* Banks say no deal on Greek writedown

* Italy promises to raise pension age, provide economic action plan

By Luke Baker and Julien Toyer

BRUSSELS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Negotiations with Greece's private creditors on a second rescue package for Athens have broken down, throwing efforts to resolve the euro zone debt crisis into doubt despite progress in boosting the region's rescue fund to one trillion euros.

German sources said Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were now negotiating directly with representatives of the banking industry, on the sidelines of a euro zone summit, to try to forge a deal in which the banks will accept a writedown of at least 50 percent on their holdings of Greek government bonds.

The talks were expected to drag on deep into the night, with positions far apart on perhaps the most complex element of the three-part "comprehensive package" that the currency bloc is trying to pull together.

The three elements are so intertwined that euro zone leaders face an all-or-nothing showdown.

"They only started now on the hard core of the matter, which is the PSI (private sector involvement)," one EU source said.

The leaders earlier made progress on two other elements -- bank recapitalisation and moves to scale up the size of the euro zone's 440 billion euro ($600 bln) bailout fund.

A draft statement from the summit, obtained by Reuters, outlined two options to leverage the fund designed to shore up heavily indebted states and thwart market attacks.

It said details would not be nailed down until next month, suggesting the second summit in four days will have sketched broad intentions but failed to produce anything like a detailed master plan to resolve a crisis that threatens the single currency project.

"It is going to disappoint the market, particularly given the emphasis policymakers put on this meeting," said Jessica Hoversen, foreign exchange analyst at MF Global in New York.

A senior EU source said the euro zone leaders wanted private sector creditors to accept a writedown of 50 percent or more on their holdings of Greek government debt to reduce Greece's total outstanding private sector debt by around 100 billion euros.

While there is consensus on the need for European banks to raise around 110 billion euros ($150 billion) in extra capital to withstand a potential Greek debt default, governments and banks are at odds over the scale of write-offs.

"There has been no agreement on any Greek deal or a specific 'haircut'," Charles Dallara, head of the Institute for International Finance which represents private sector creditors, said in a statement.

"There is no agreement on any element of a deal."

Sources said the IIF could present another offer, a move that is likely to further extend negotiations.

EU leaders did agree the outlines of a package on bank recapitalisation, including raising the core capital ratios of European banks to 9 percent by the end of June 2012, but they did not provide a headline figure, which will depend in part on negotiations over Greek debt.

The European Banking Authority said the euro zone banks needed to raise 106 billion euros of capital to meet that ratio with Greek and Spanish banks facing the most work.

STRONGER RESCUE FUND

For the European Financial Stability Facility, where  progress was made, one proposal involves creating a special purpose investment vehicle (SPIV) to tap foreign sovereign and private investors, such as Chinese and Middle Eastern wealth funds, to buy bonds of troubled euro zone countries.

The other method for scaling up the rescue fund, which was set up last year, involves using it to offer partial guarantees to purchasers of new euro zone debt.

The two options could be used simultaneously and the International Monetary Fund could also help.

Euro zone finance ministers will be asked to finalise the terms and conditions in November, the draft statement said.

EU sources said the EFSF was expected to be leveraged by something like a factor of four giving it scope of around 1 trillion euros.

It has about 250-275 billion euros available given funds set aside for aid to Greece, Ireland and Portugal and for recapitalising the region's banks.

Sarkozy is expected to talk with Chinese President Hu Jintao soon on Beijing's participation in the bailout fund.

U.S. stocks rallied on the pledge to boost the power of the fund, while the euro fell as investors awaited details that will not be forthcoming until next month.

European leaders' pattern of responding too little, too late to a debt crisis that began in Greece has spawned a wider economic and political crisis that threatens to undermine the euro single currency and the European Union project.

ITALIAN INTENT

Earlier, Merkel won a parliamentary vote of support for strengthening the rescue fund after warning in a dramatic speech that Europe was facing its most difficult situation since the end of World War Two.

Merkel told parliament that private bondholders would have to take a substantial write-down so that Greece's debt could be reduced to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from 160 percent this year.

Experts said that implied a 50 percent "haircut" for private investors.

"The world is watching Germany and Europe to see if we are ready and able to take responsibility.

If the euro fails, Europe fails," said Merkel, in a characteristically sober tone.

"No one should take for it for granted that there will be peace and affluence in Europe in the next half century," she said.

Also weighing on the summit was deep concern about Italy, which is now in the bond market firing line.

Under huge pressure from its euro zone partners, Rome promised a package of reform steps to boost growth and control its public debt, including labour and pensions reforms and additional revenues from property divestments.

In a letter sent to the summit in Brussels, the government said it would produce a plan of action to boost growth by Nov. 15, promising to raise the retirement age to 67, cut red tape and modernise state administration to improve conditions for business and raise 5 billion euros a year from divestments and improved returns from state property.

Rome's inability to deliver a substantive plan for reforming its pensions system has raised doubts about Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's seriousness in tackling a crisis that threatens the euro zone's third largest economy.

Italy has the euro zone's largest sovereign bond market, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, 120 percent of GDP. If it went the same way as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the rescue fund would not have enough money to bail Rome out.

Its partners remain sceptical -- a draft summit statement showed euro zone leaders will welcome Italy's plans to increase the pension age but will ask for detailed plans on how it plans to achieve that.

BERLIN | Wed Oct 26, 2011 2:45pm EDT

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Europe not to be complacent about its peace and prosperity on Wednesday, as German lawmakers approved plans to boost the firepower of the euro zone rescue fund ahead of an emergency EU summit.

Addressing a packed parliament before the vote, Merkel urged the lower house Bundestag to fulfill its "historic duty" and said Europe was in its toughest phase since the end of World War Two.

"No one should take for it for granted that there will be peace and affluence in Europe in the next half century," said Merkel, a pastor's daughter brought up in Communist eastern Germany.

"The world is watching Germany and Europe to see if we are ready and able to take responsibility.

If the euro fails, Europe fails," said Merkel, in a characteristically sober tone.

The vote binds Merkel to sticking closely to the text of the motion passed by the Bundestag, boosting her bargaining power at the Brussels summit on issues such as the European Central Bank's involvement in tackling the crisis.

The prospects of a comprehensive deal looked dim, however, with disagreements remaining in several crucial areas.

The Bundestag's vice president said of the 596 lawmakers who voted, 503 backed the motion, 89 opposed it and there were four abstentions.

"With its clear, cross-party majority, the German parliament has strengthened the hand of the German government in its negotiations on fighting the euro debt crisis," said Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle after the vote.

"With this, the government can fight forcefully for our interests," added Westerwelle, a member of the Free Democrats (FDP), Merkel's junior coalition partner.

In a minor boost to her waning authority at home, she won the vote without having to rely on opposition support.

However, 15 rebels from her own center-right coalition either voted against the motion or abstained, highlighting the struggle Merkel faces in convincing Germans of the need for Europe's biggest economy to help its indebted partners.

Merkel is battling sliding ratings for herself and her coalition over her handling of the euro zone crisis.

Critics at home and abroad have accused her of dithering, thereby exacerbating the debt crisis, and frustration is rife.

DIM PROSPECTS

The proposals to increase the effectiveness of the 440 billion euro ($610 billion) European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) without pouring more taxpayers' money into it, have been the subject of fierce debate in Germany, the biggest contributor to the rescue fund, and the rest of the euro zone.

Disagreements remain, including over how to scale up the EFSF.

One option is to use it to offer guarantees to purchasers of new euro zone debt, the other to use part of its capacity to set up a special purpose investment vehicle to attract money from sovereign wealth funds and other investors.

A combination may also be possible.

Merkel said it was justifiable to take the chance of higher risks stemming from leveraging the EFSF and that failure to give the fund more firepower would be irresponsible.

"The goal of the meeting tonight must be to get a result under which Greece will by 2020 have a debt to gross domestic product ratio of 120 percent," said Merkel.

Under the sustainability scenarios put forward by Greece's 'troika' of lenders -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- that would mean a 50 percent writedown for private sector bondholders.

The role of the European Central Bank in resolving the crisis is also subject to dispute, France wanting a deeper and more direct ECB involvement, something Germany strongly opposes.

The motion passed by German lawmakers states that the EFSF cannot be financed through the ECB and with a leveraged EFSF, the central bank will no longer need to buy bonds on the secondary market.

The incoming head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, strongly signaled the bank would go on buying bonds.

German lawmakers said this was not necessarily a rebuff to them as the phrase in their motion expresses an expectation and stops short of saying the ECB cannot buy bonds if necessary.

Merkel's hands have been tied by a Constitutional Court ruling last month, which demanded a greater say for German lawmakers.

That has frustrated some EU leaders eager to implement quick solutions.

Lawmakers -- either in the lower house's full session or its 41-member budget committee -- will have to be consulted again about the EU leaders' summit conclusions.

BERLIN | Wed Oct 26, 2011 6:54am EDT

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday she was committed to achieving sustainable decisions at a summit of European leaders later to tackle the euro zone debt crisis but that no one should expect solutions that work overnight.

"I will work toward reaching sustainable decisions this evening," Merkel told parliament shortly before a vote by German lawmakers on plans to leverage the euro zone bailout fund.

Merkel also said that she wanted to get Greece back on its feet as quickly as possible but that it would be a long path and a debt write down alone would not solve Greece's problems.

"We must certainly accompany Greece for quite some time to come," she said.

If, as expected, German lawmakers pass the motion, Merkel's negotiating hand will be strengthened in the Brussels talks.

BRUSSELS | Wed Oct 26, 2011 9:41pm EDT

BRUSSELS Oct 27 (Reuters) - Euro zone leaders and banks are close to reaching a deal on a 50 percent writedown for private bondholders on their Greek debt, an EU source said on Thursday.

Negotiations at a summit meeting of euro zone leaders were centred on agreeing a writedown or "haircut" with private bondholders on a voluntary basis.

Euro zone states want private investors to accept the haircut in an effort to reduce Greece's debt burden by about 100 billion euros.

Failure to agree on a voluntary writedown could lead to a full-scale default in Greece's debt, with a heavy knock-on impact on markets.

* Euro, stocks rally after euro summit deal

* Euro zone, banks agree to 50 pct private sector losses on Greek bonds

* Details of deal to be finalised by the end of the year -- EU

* Euro zone says to scale up EFSF bailout fund to 1.0 trln euro

By Luke Baker and Julien Toyer

BRUSSELS, Oct 27(Reuters) - The euro and stocks rallied on Thursday after European leaders struck a deal to provide debt relief for Greece, but analysts warned the plan would fail to halt the euro zone's two-year-old debt crisis unless crucial details were resolved soon.

After a summit in Brussels, governments announced an agreement under which private banks and insurers would accept 50 percent losses on their Greek debt holdings in the latest bid to reduce Athens' massive debt load to sustainable levels.

Reached after more than eight hours of hard-nosed negotiations between bankers, heads of state and the IMF, the deal also foresees a recapitalisation of hard-hit European banks and a leveraging of the bloc's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), to give it firepower of 1.0 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion).

European stocks surged to a 12-week high and the euro shot above $1.40 to reach its top level against the dollar in seven weeks following the deal, which had appeared at risk due to deep differences between Berlin and Paris.

But economists noted that key aspects of the deal, including the mechanics of boosting the EFSF and providing Greek debt relief, would take weeks to pin down, meaning the plan could still unravel over the details.

"There is plenty of room to doubt whether each of the key aspects of the package will deliver within its own space," said Malcolm Barr, an economist at J.P. Morgan. "The hope of EU policy makers is that the whole will be perceived as more than the sum of its rather questionable parts."

Three months ago, euro zone leaders unveiled another agreement that was meant to draw a line under the debt woes that threaten to tear apart the 12-year old currency bloc.

But they realised within weeks that it was inadequate given the depth of Greece's economic problems and the vulnerability of their banks.

The new deal aims to address these holes.

"ABSOLUTELY SUSTAINABLE"

Under it, the private sector agreed to voluntarily accept a nominal 50 percent cut in its bond investments to reduce Greece's debt burden by 100 billion euros, cutting its debts to 120 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020, from 160 percent now.

The euro zone will offer "credit enhancements" or sweeteners to the private sector totalling 30 billion euros.

The aim is to complete negotiations on the package by the end of the year, so Greece has a full, second financial aid programme in place before 2012.

The value of that package, EU sources said, would be 130 billion euros -- up from 109 billion euros in the July deal.

"The debt is absolutely sustainable now," Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said in Brussels after the deal was struck.

"Greece can settle its accounts from the past now, once and for all."

A top lawyer for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said that because banks had agreed to accept the losses, the deal was unlikely to trigger a "credit event" in which default insurance contracts would be paid out.

In a bid to convince markets that they can prevent larger countries like Italy and Spain from being swept up by the crisis, euro zone leaders also agreed to scale up the EFSF, the 440 billion euro bailout fund that they have already used to provide help to Ireland, Portugal and Greece.

Around 250 billion euro remaining in the fund will be leveraged 4-5 times, producing a headline figure of around 1.0 trillion euros, which will be deployed in a variety of ways.

The EFSF will be leveraged in two ways, either by offering insurance, or first-loss guarantees, to purchasers of euro zone debt in the primary market, or via a special purpose investment vehicle that will be set up in the coming weeks and which is aimed at attracting investment from China and Brazil.

The methods could be combined, giving the EFSF greater flexibility, the euro zone leaders said.

But EU finance ministers are not expected to agree on the nitty-gritty elements of how the scaled up EFSF will work until some time in November, with the exact date not fixed.

There is also concern about Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's commitment to implementing reforms seen as crucial for restoring confidence in the bloc's third largest economy.

Dogged by scandals, Berlusconi has promised to raise the retirement age to 67 by 2026 and attempt other reforms, but the EU is reserving judgement.

SARKOZY TO TALK TO HU

Japan and Canada welcomed the euro zone agreement.

China's official Xinhua news agency said the outcome was "positive but filled with difficulties".

A spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry confirmed that President Hu Jintao would speak with French President Nicolas Sarkozy by phone later.

An EU source told Reuters the conversation would centre on Beijing's possible participation in the bailout fund.

Beijing has so far been a big buyer of bonds issued by the EFSF, which is triple-A rated by credit agencies.

As with the July 21 agreement, the concern is that Thursday's deal will only work if the fine print can be promptly agreed with the private sector, represented by the Institute of International Finance (IIF).

Charles Dallara, the managing director of the IIF, said those he represented were committed to making the deal work.

"We believe (bank take-up) is likely to be very, very high," Dallara said on Thursday.

"All parties recognised not only that the future of Greece but also the future of Europe and the future of the world economy was at stake."

Josef Ackermann, chairman of the IIF and CEO of Germany's largest bank Deutsche Bank , described it as an "acceptable compromise".

Alongside the hit to the private sector, euro zone leaders agreed the banking sector needs recapitalising to the tune of around 106 billion euros.

German sources told Reuters that four German lenders -- NordLB , LBBW , Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank -- would be asked to shore up their capital.

Three leading French banks ruled out the need for government help in meeting tougher capital requirements.

"While the headlines look good, the devil is in the details," said Damien Boey, equity strategist at Credit Swisse in Sydney.

"We don't actually know how they are planning to increase the bail-out fund size from 440 billion euros to a trillion.

On top of that, there are some questions as to whether one trillion euros in itself is enough."

There were corporate doubters, too. Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell said it planned to curb its investments in the European Union in future due to doubts about the bloc's chances of recovering from the crisis.

"Europe's macroeconomic position can only recover and the sovereign debt crisis can only be addressed through underlying economic growth," Simon Henry, chief financial officer, told reporters on a conference call on Thursday.

"We do not see the European Union creating the conditions for that, in fact quite the opposite," he said.

By Luke Baker and Julien Toyer

BRUSSELS, Oct 27(Reuters) - Euro zone leaders struck a last-minute deal on Thursday to contain the currency bloc's two-year-old debt crisis but are now under pressure to finalise the details of their plan to slash Greece's debt burden and strengthen their rescue fund.

After a summit in Brussels, governments announced an agreement under which private banks and insurers would accept 50 percent losses on their Greek debt holdings in the latest bid to cut Athens' 360 billion euro debt load to sustainable levels.

Economists polled by Reuters on Thursday were split down the middle over whether the writedown was big enough, with 24 of 47 saying it wasn't and the remainder saying it was.

Reached after more than eight hours of hard-nosed negotiations between bankers, heads of state and the IMF, the deal also foresees a recapitalisation of hard-hit European banks and a leveraging of the bloc's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), to give it firepower of 1.0 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion).

U.S. stocks surged more than 2 percent in early trade and European shares climbed 4 percent to a 12-week high on the deal.

They were led higher by banks which raced up over 9 percent, with BNP , Societe Generale and Credit Agricole of France leading the way.

The euro shot above $1.41 to reach its top level against the dollar in seven weeks.

But key aspects of the deal, including the mechanics of boosting the EFSF and providing Greek debt relief, could take weeks or even months to pin down, raising the risk of the plan unravelling as the last one did.

"I see the main risk is that we are left waiting too long again for the implementation of these agreements," European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny said on Thursday.

"Speed is very important here," he told national broadcaster ORF.

Three months ago, euro zone leaders unveiled another agreement that was meant to draw a line under the debt woes that threaten to tear apart the 12-year old currency bloc.

In a matter of weeks they realised it was inadequate given the depth of Greece's economic problems and the vulnerability of European banks.

The euro zone will offer 30 billion euros in "credit enhancements" or sweeteners to the private sector to get them on board.

The aim is to complete negotiations on the package by the end of the year, so Greece has a full, second financial aid programme in place before 2012.

The value of that package, EU sources said, would be 130 billion euros -- up from 109 billion euros in the July deal.

"The debt is absolutely sustainable now," Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said.

A top lawyer for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said that because banks had agreed to accept the losses, the deal was unlikely to trigger a "credit event" under which credit default swaps (CDS), or default insurance contracts, would have to be paid out.

In a bid to convince markets that they can prevent larger countries like Italy and Spain from being swept up by the crisis, euro zone leaders also agreed to scale up the EFSF, the 440 billion euro bailout fund they created in May 2010 and have already used to provide aid to Ireland, Portugal and Greece.

Dogged by scandals, Berlusconi has promised to raise the retirement age to 67 by 2026 and attempt other reforms, but the EU is reserving judgement after repeated backsliding from Rome in recent months.

SARKOZY TALKS TO HU

French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke by phone with Chinese President Hu Jintao on Thursday.

Beijing is a big holder of European sovereign debt and an EU source told Reuters the conversation would centre on Beijing's possible participation in the bailout fund.

"China hopes all these measures will help stabilise the European financial market and conquer the current difficulties and promote the economic recovery and development," Hu said, according to China's state television.

Japan and Canada welcomed the euro zone agreement.

Earlier, China's official Xinhua news agency had said the outcome of the summit was "positive but filled with difficulties".

As with the July 21 agreement, the concern is that Thursday's deal will only work if the fine print can be promptly agreed with the private sector, represented by the Institute of International Finance (IIF).

LONDON | Thu Oct 27, 2011 3:08am EDT

LONDON Oct 27 (Reuters) - European shares surged to a 12-week high in early trade on Thursday after euro zone leaders agreed to boost the region's rescue fund to 1 trillion euros and struck a deal with private lenders to accept a 50 percent cut on their Greek bonds.

The private sector agreed to voluntarily accept a cut in its bond investments to reduce Greece's debt burden by 100 billion euros, while around 250 billion euros of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) will be leveraged 4 to 5 times to produce a headline figure of around 1 trillion.

"Even though details are not yet in place, the extension of the EFSF will build a firewall between Greece and the rest.

With the agreement on a 50 percent haircut for Greece, quite a bit of uncertainty has been taken off the table as well," said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels.

"It was very important to convince the market that this is a good plan.

The restoration of confidence is an important step in the healing process.

However, we will see whether the recovery in risky assets has legs."

At 0706 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top  European shares was up 2.6 percent at 1,009.45 points, the highest since early August.

The European banking sector , which has been hit hard by its large exposure to peripheral euro zone countries, spiked 4.5 percent to top the gainers' list, following the agreement, which will be accompanied by a recapitalisation of the European banking sector by around 106 billion euros.

By Antoni Slodkowski

TOKYO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The euro hit a seven-week high on Thursday after EU leaders and banks reached a deal on a 50 percent writedown for private bondholders on their Greek debt and made progress in other areas crucial to stemming the debt crisis.

The euro jumped 0.6 percent to $1.4000 , breaking through a wall of orders and charging past stop-loss points on the way, also bolstered by the EU's progress on bank recapitalisation and its move to scale up the size of the euro zone's 440 billion euro ($600 billion) bailout fund, the EFSF.

Under the deal, the private sector agreed to voluntarily accept a nominal 50 percent loss on its bond investments to reduce Greece's debt burden by 100 billion euros, cutting its debt to 120 percent of GDP by 2020 from 160 percent now.

While the final summit statement fell short of the detailed "comprehensive plan" many had hoped for, the leaders made enough progress to spark a relief rally across battered riskier assets.

The euro zone's rescue fund will be leveraged four or five times to about 1 trillion euros, but EU finance ministers are not expected to agree until November on the nitty-gritty elements of how the scaled up EFSF, or European Financial Stability Facility, will work.

"The devil is in the details here ... we don't actually know how they are planning to increase the bailout fund size from 440 billion euros to a trillion.

On top of that, there are some questions as to whether 1 trillion euros in itself is enough," said Damien Boey, an equity strategist at Credit Suisse in Sydney.

The euro's rally stalled at $1.4, around the level where an option barrier was rumoured to be placed, ahead of stop losses lurking at $1.4010-20 and resistance at $1.4013, a 61.8 percent retracement of its August-October decline.

Against the yen, the euro was 0.4 percent higher at 106.25 yen .

NEARING RECORD LOWS

The dollar zeroed in on a record low against the yen after the Bank of Japan, as widely expected, decided to ease policy by expanding asset purchases by 5 trillion yen ($65.8 billion), to 20 trillion yen.

The dollar dipped 0.3 percent to 75.95 yen , a stone's throw from the record low of 75.71 yen plumbed the day before.

That was because some funds which went dollar long, expecting that Tokyo would deliver a "double punch" of easing and intervention at the same time, started dumping positions.

"This (BOJ step) was very predictable and foreign investors may be disappointed that the BOJ didn't deliver something extra.

They may buy back the yen in London trading hours," said a senior trader for Japanese bank.

"Retail and interbank dealers are still sticking to their (dollar/yen) longs, and unless we have intervention will probably wait for London time to fully unwind them," he said predicting the pair's deeper fall outside Asian trade.

Traders also cited talk of an option barrier at 75.50 yen and a bigger one at 75.00 yen. Traders also warned of chunky stop-loss dollar offers at 75.00 yen.

The move in the euro and other risk currencies saw the dollar index hit a new seven-week low of 75.757, down from an overnight high of 76.662. The index has been on a downtrend in the past few weeks.

"A dovish Fed, easing in dollar funding/liquidity conditions, OK corporate earnings from any company that earns revenue abroad, and fading fears of crisis as we await decent Q3 GDP data, all make for a fundamentally bearish dollar outlook," said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale.

* World stocks hit highest in eight weeks

* Euro at seven-week high vs dollar after summit deal

* Safe-haven Treasuries, Bunds fall;

Greek, Italian yields ease

By Dominic Lau

LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - World stocks and the euro rose to their highest levels in nearly two months  on Thursday after European leaders struck a deal to resolve the two-year-old euro zone sovereign debt crisis, which threatens the survival of the common currency.

Brent crude and copper prices also rallied.

Prices of safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds  fell while those of highly indebted euro zone countries gained.

As concerns of a near-term default eased, the cost of insuring Greek debt against default also fell.

The deal, announced in the early hours of Thursday, will see private holders of Greek bonds accept a 50 percent loss on their investment, while banks will be recapitalised and the size of the currency bloc's rescue fund will be leveraged to 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion).

"Full credit to them for achieving something, even if it's not the be-all and end-all that we'd all really like.

But it takes us further away from the edge of the abyss for the time being," Nomura rate strategist Sean Maloney said.

Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 gained 3 percent, while European bank shares , which have been hit by concerns that a Greek default would lead to a banking crisis, surged nearly 7 percent, with Greek bank stocks up more than 10 percent.

Greece's benchmark stock index climbed 6 percent and yields on 10-year Greek government bonds fell 29.5 basis points to 24.728 percent.

Yields on Italy's 10-year debt  slipped 11.6 basis points to 5.814 percent, also helped by the European Central Bank's bond buying, traders said.

U.S. stock index futures   put on 1.7 to 2.1 percent, indicating a firm opening on Wall Street, ahead of the release of the U.S. third quarter GDP data at 1230 GMT.

World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index  advanced 1.9 percent to hit their highest level since early September.

The global benchmark is up 10.9 percent so far this month, on track for its biggest monthly gain in more than two years, driven by hopes that euro zone policymakers would announce a decisive plan to end the turmoil at the summit.

Copper was up 4.2 percent on Thursday and on track for its best weekly percentage gain since January 2009, while Brent crude rose 1.8 percent to above $110 a barrel.

Safe-haven gold dipped 0.3 percent to above $1,720 an ounce, its first fall in a week.

TOUGH ROAD AHEAD

But analysts said more work would still be needed to solve the bloc's problems.

"It would be clearly premature to declare the euro crisis as fully resolved.

Much more needs to be done, especially regarding fiscal consolidation," Credit Suisse Private Banking said.

"Achieving such a consolidation will be difficult in a phase of slow growth, or in some cases recession."

"Nevertheless, it is our impression that EU leaders have made significant progress on all fronts.

This suggests that the rebound in risk assets that has been underway in recent days may well continue for some time."

The euro was up 0.9 percent at $1.4025 and 0.3 percent at 106.31 yen.

"The market was short risk and long dollars, so this has boosted the euro.

But above $1.40, the air is a bit thin for the euro and it is likely to struggle there," Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS Global Banking, said.

The announcement also boosted high-yielding currencies, with the Australian dollar up 2.2 percent at $1.0625.

The dollar zeroed in on a record low against the yen after the Bank of Japan, as widely expected, decided to ease policy by expanding asset purchases by 5 trillion yen ($65.8 billion), to 20 trillion yen.

The dollar was down 0.5 percent at 75.82 yen , not far from the record low of 75.71 yen plumbed the day before.

EU and euro zone leaders' comments on debt crisis

Euro Zone »

BRUSSELS | Wed Oct 26, 2011 11:40pm EDT

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone leaders said on Thursday they had reached agreement on a comprehensive package of measures to tackle the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.

The leaders said private holders of Greek debt would accept a 50 percent writedown on their holdings as part of a scheme to reduce the country's debt burden.

And the euro zone heads of state and government also agreed on the need to recapitalize European banks and to increase the firepower of the euro zone bailout fund, the EFSF, to about one trillion euros.

Following are comments from leaders after the talks:

GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL

ON GREEK DEBT:

"Our goal is that the debt of Greece by 2020 is 120 percent (of GDP)."

"A nominal haircut of 50 percent has been agreed.

On the basis of this, we will have a new program for Greece with a value of 100 billion euros."

"There will be a reinforced monitoring regime in connection with the fulfillment of the Greek obligations."

"That will be anchored in a memorandum of understanding.

There will be a permanent presence there.

It will be possible to monitor the measures taken by Greece.

I think that this is better than when every three months a 'troika' travels there and back, a permanent system of supervision."

ON THE EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY:

"We know that the optimization of the EFSF is necessary ... in connection with avoiding any contagion effect.

The ECB is not involved.

"We have agreed that by the end of November the... framework... will be worked out by the finance ministers.

It is important that through these two options we maximize the effectiveness of the EFSF, that we have a leverage of four to five times.

"It is very difficult, without having ever used the instruments, to say what this really means.

We believe we will have a lot of flexibility to protect the euro and avoid contagion risks.

We say that we can achieve around about 1 trillion euros."

EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUEL BARROSO

ON THE ROLE OF BANKS IN ENDING THE CRISIS:

"Our goal is to ensure banks maintain lending to the real economy.

"Tonight's conclusions also make clear that banks should be subject to constraints regarding the distribution of dividends and bonus payments until recapitalization is complete.

"The technical work needed to finalize certain aspects of this package will be completed by the relevant authorities in the coming weeks."

ON SITUATION IN ITALY:

"There are here several measures and commitments.

And there is afterwards a task given to the (European) Commission and to the Italian authorities to provide all of the necessary data for the implementation.

"So the key is implementation.

This is the key. It is not enough to make commitments, it is necessary now to check if they are really implementing."

OUTGOING EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET

ASKED IF HE THOUGHT THE DECISIONS ARE ENOUGH TO STEM THE

CRISIS:

"I think they have to be fully implemented... as rapidly and effectively as possible.

And I have only to say that what counts is the level of confidence.

"What I heard in this European Council was the expression of the will of the heads (of state and government).

That is in my opinion extremely important.

What is backing this orientation is the will, the collegial will, if I may, of the heads of state and government that are behind.

"But again no complacency -- very hard work, very hard work."

FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY

"The summit allowed us to adopt the components of a global response, of an ambitious response, of a credible response to the crisis that is sweeping across the euro zone."

EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY

ON COOPERATION IN EUROPE:

"Compared to eight or 10 years ago, the pressure which leaders put on each other has become much more effective, as the events of the last days show.

Today no government can afford to underestimate the possible impact of for instance public debts or housing bubbles in another euro zone country on its own economy;

they would be punished by the voters, and by the markets.

Peer pressure has become more effective, because the money of their taxpayers is at stake."

ON ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (ECB) AND INCOMING ECB

PRESIDENT MARIO DRAGHI:

"If the current president or the upcoming president are saying that they will intervene until the new mechanism is really put into place, it is up to them to decide.

So we are not interfering in this, we are not asking for it. We take note of the declarations made recently by Mr Draghi but we have no demands and nothing to request."

ON GREECE:

"We want to put Greece on track, where in 2020 it will have reduced its public debt to 120 percent of GDP. Since July, market conditions have worsened.

The new plan includes additional effort by the state sector.

"It also includes a voluntary contribution by private creditors who have lent to Greece.

It was agreed by them tonight and amounts to nominal discount of 50 percent of notional Greek debt."

ON EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY (EFSF):

"A sufficient firewall against contagion -- thanks to an agreement to multiply to up five-fold the firepower of the EFSF.

The leverage could be up to one trillion (euros) under certain assumptions about market conditions and investors' responsiveness in view of economic policies.

"We have identified two approaches for the EFSF.

The first one aims at getting credit enhancement to sovereign bonds issued by member states.

Under the second approach, the fund could set up one or several (special purpose vehicles) SPVs to finance its operations.

Each option could lead to leverage of up to four to five times.

They can be used simultaneously so as to increase the robustness of the financial strategy."

"We are all aware the situation is serious.

The situation was evolving into a systemic concern.

This threat has to be contained."

IRISH PRIME MINISTER ENDA KENNY

ON BANK RECAPITALISATION:

"In respect of recapitalization of the European banks this has been achieved without any damage to Irish interests."

ON IRISH SITUATION:

"The communication is very clear that this is a unique and individual situation for Greece and clearly there is the continued funding for Ireland.

This is well recognized and specifically presented by the leaders."

Following are comments from EU leaders earlier:

POLISH PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK

ON EU INTEGRATION:

"I had the impression all partners understand that we need enhanced integration, not only at the level of the Eurogroup but at the level of the whole European Union."

ON BANK CAPITAL QUALITY:

"The key issue was the issue of high quality capital, the 9 percent ratio that was adopted that we need to maintain this ratio.

And we also adopted certain elements of the way we should proceed to attain this goal.

An emotional element during this debate, was the fact of making this exceptional circumstance and not permanent element... so this will not be a permanent solution for the future."

ON AGREEING A PACKAGE OF MEASURES:

"The banking element is part of a broader package... All participants were fully aware that the draft annex to this statement concerning the recapitalization of banks will work only when the euro area approves other elements that are currently being debated.

"Bank recapitalization without the remaining elements, such as the so-called firewall... wouldn't have any chance of success.

So the statement today is a pre-condition and it's really an introduction for looking for further elements in the euro area with greater comfort."

ON POLITICAL AGREEMENT:

"Bank recapitalization is an issue concerning all member states.

This project cannot be seen in isolation and independently of the other elements.

My impression is that all 27 accept the idea of bank recapitalization in this statement.

"If you are asking whether we are expecting that all decisions will be taken today during the euro area meeting I would be very cautious to make such a statement.

"I think we are very close to a full political agreement, however there are some important details that might perhaps require more time.

"It is important, however, that tonight the euro area should demonstrate that a political agreement has been achieved and the only things that remain are important, but only technical issues."

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON

"We made good progress tonight.

It is very much in Britain's interest that we sort out these problems and solve this crisis.

"We made good progress on the bank recapitalization.

That wasn't watered down, it has now been agreed.

It will only go ahead when the other parts of a full package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight."

Following are comments from earlier, ahead of the EU leaders' meeting:

IRISH PRIME MINISTER ENDA KENNY

"I understand there has been some progress made in a number of areas, but clearly leaders of the euro zone will have their own individual points to put up here.

As I said, the important thing here that the fully flexibility of the facilities that were approved be used now to bring certainty, and certainty of intent, for everybody, from both the (European) Council and the euro zone in particular."

AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR WERNER FAYMANN

ON HAIRCUT FOR GREEK BONDHOLDERS:

"The wish is to come up with a voluntary haircut, I think that is right, but until that is negotiated we can't announce it. It's still open."

"We always said 40-50 percent is part of the negotiations but we have to be fair because we don't know what the counterparties would ask for that."

ON EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY (EFSF):

"The other issue is to improve the way the rescue fund is used.

To make it strong enough that it would last for a few months or years would be an elementary step forward.

If we always have to call summits against the background of a crisis it doesn't create a lot of trust.

"I'm very much in favor of making better use of the rescue fund and giving it more bearing capacity."

DUTCH PRIME MINISTER MARK RUTTE

"We need a real solution, we won't buy anything with mediocre compromises.

Some things really need to happen.

"We need today to talk about Greece and ensure that Greek debt is sustainable and that we're finally finished with this business.

We must talk about the banks and how they get through this difficult phase.

"We must ensure that this bazooka, the European rescue fund, is strong enough to show the market that we mean it. We also have to make sure this can't happen in the future.

We need strong supervision and live up to our promises."

"We are in this job to take decisions.

It's not easy, but it really has to happen."

BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER YVES LETERME

"I think we will have a solution for Greece.

It is very important to ask for a voluntary effort by the banks to reduce Greece's debt.

It is also an effort through the EFSF to make credit accessible at reasonable rates for Greece."

ON WORK AHEAD:

"I think it is work that advances step-by-step.

But the step we are going to take today or tonight is a very important step toward a total restoration of the confidence in the euro zone."

"It's an economic union in the making so it does not yet have the firepower it should have, but we're taking steps forward.

Let's hope for tonight."

ON EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY (EFSF) BAILOUT

FUND:

"Let's hope we succeed in giving (the EFSF) enough convincing firepower.

It's one of the two to three most important points we still have to tackle."

"I think that in effect we would need to be a whole bit above 1,000 billion euros."

GREEK PRIME MINISTER GEORGE PAPANDREOU

"Our challenge today is not simply to save the euro.

It is to safeguard the ideas we cherish so much in Europe:

Peace and cooperation amongst our nations, social cohesion and solidarity without prejudice amongst our people.

"From our side the Greek people are making a superhuman effort to put our house in order, to make our economy confident, viable, prosperous and create a better future for the Greek people, for our country.

"Now is the time for the European leadership to collectively take decisions to end the uncertainty, end the crisis, turn the page and make sure we make a big step forward for the better future and prosperity and security of our peoples in Europe."

EUROGROUP PRESIDENT AND LUXEMBOURG'S PRIME MINISTER

JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER

ON ITALY:

"Our Italian friends know well that we have to assume that we will be informed this evening that there will be significant, structural (budget) consolidation efforts from Italy.

That is a must."

ON AGREEING DECISIONS:

"I think that if we make our decisions in such a way that they work under pressure, then we will have made the right decisions."

Euro Zone »

Thu Oct 27, 2011 2:43am EDT

(Reuters) - Euro zone leaders said on Thursday they had reached agreement after late-night talks on a comprehensive package of measures to tackle the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.

The deal calls for private owners of Greek bonds to accept a 50 percent writedown on their investment.

The scope of the new version of the euro zone's rescue fund would be increased substantially and equivalent to about 1 trillion euros.

Following is a selection of comments from analysts, experts and political figures.

CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER

"I see as positive steps, the actions taken by our European friends just a few hours ago," Harper said in the Australian city of Perth, where he will attend a summit of Commonwealth country leaders.

"Of course, we still await the elaboration of further details and successful implementation, as we approach the G20 summit (next month)."

PHILIPPINE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR AMANDO TETANGCO

"(The) market has welcomed the move ... The agreements are comprehensive, but require the cooperation of the European leaders, multilateral agencies like the IMF, and the private sector.

"The burden sharing has been laid out, but this, I believe, rests quite firmly on what the statement calls 'reaffirmation of the inflexible determination' among member states to honor all their commitments to sustainable fiscal conditions and structural reforms.

"This confidence is vital in ensuring the speedy normalization in the markets.

This morning we saw broad positive reaction from the market.

But as they say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

We are nevertheless hopeful the measures would be sufficient, at least, in shoring up confidence and calm in the markets."

THOMAS LAM, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, OSK-DMG, SINGAPORE

"The headlines provided some solace to the market.

We've moved from a point in time when we were wondering whether we'd get anything from this meeting.

"The markets reacted positively.

Broadly, it's still pretty incomplete.

There are numerous moving parts to the euro zone situation.

Hence, it must be a continuous process.

While the Europeans appear to be getting the ball moving in the right direction, it is extremely dangerous to be complacent at this time.

"Key things to watch out for are the state of the euro zone economy, the political backdrop and the ECB's role.

If the euro zone economy weakens, costs would rise.

If we get more uncertainties with regards to the political leadership, it could affect the plan.

The ECB's role must also be clarified."

DAMIEN BOEY, EQUITY STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, SYDNEY

"While the headlines look good, the devil is in the details here.

It's great news that they've managed to increase the bail-out fund to 1 trillion euros plus agree on some sort of haircut arrangement for the private investors in Greek debt.

"The problem is, we don't actually know how they are planning to increase the bail-out fund size from 440 billion euros to a trillion.

On top of that, there are some questions as to whether one trillion euros in itself is enough.

"If you had one trillion euros and you had the ECB on board, that would be enough.

But there's been no announcement that the ECB's on board so far. If the ECB is not actually willing to use its own money to prop up the bail out fund .... then there's a problem.

This plan actually doesn't work."

JEREMY FRIESEN, COMMODITY STRATEGIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, HONG KONG

"If they extend the EFSF, that's obviously positive and will reduce some of the risks that we have in the European market.

Anything they can do to create consumer power and growth would translate into better commodities prices.

"It will be too optimistic to hope for any quick solution as fiscal issues still need to be dealt with in Greece and Italy, but it looks like the Europeans are treating this seriously.

"In the near term, credit and default risks are being navigated by EFSF.

Recession issues could continue to linger and that will weigh on commodities market for a while."

BARCLAYS CAPITAL

In a note, Barclays Capital said the summit "has not yet produced measurable results or at least notable progress on various issues of key importance.

"For instance, news on the leverage of the EFSF has been patchy at best and it remains to be seen what the final agreement on this might be.

"Finally, while the government of Italy has reportedly indicated further reform efforts in a letter to the European Commission uncertainty remains about the degree of political commitment of the incumbent government.

"Therefore, in sum, financial market participants are left with a number of important open questions and satisfactory answers have yet to be provided by the authorities."

YUSUKE SETA, COMMODITY SALES MANAGER AT NEWEDGE JAPAN

"I am a little doubtful about the EU being able to arrange the $1.4 trillion loan.

However, the market should be relieved from concern over the debt crisis.

"This could be bullish for commodities and is supported by strong equity markets, but I bet this won't last long."

TILAK DOSHI, HEAD OF ENERGY ECONOMICS, ENERGY STUDIES INSTITUTE, NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE

"I think the fundamental problem is whether the haircut to be imposed on banks that bought Greek bonds at 50 percent is enough.

"Aren't the markets pricing the required haircuts at 60 percent?

Who is going to share in the costs of re-capitalizing banks?

And with increased fire power, the question is whether they can segregate weak euro zone economies such as the PIGS, and whether Italy in particular can come up with credible plans to improve its debt and productivity levels in time."

Instead, the EU will use some elaborate financial engineering to make the fund stronger. 

 

Two options that can be combined and applied simultaneously will be used.

The first is to turn the fund into an insurance scheme in which the EFSF could guarantee a certain percentage, most likely 20 percent, of fresh debt issues. 

 

The other would be to create one or several separate funds linked to the EFSF that would raise money from private investors such as Chinese sovereign-wealth funds. 

 

EU President Herman Van Rompuy told journalists that the exact new figure of the fund remained unknown but that it could be raised substantially if the two options were used correctly. 

 

"The leverage could be around 1 trillion [euros] under certain assumptions about market conditions, the set-up and investors responsiveness in view of economic policies," Van Rompuy said.

A White House statement said U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed the "important decisions" by the EU to address the eurozone crisis and urged the swift implementation of the deal.

Financial markets surged following the announcement of the deal, with the euro climbing to its highest level against the dollar (above $1.40) in nearly two months.

But not everyone is impressed, since key details in the deal have yet to be pinned down.

Until they all become clear, it's impossible to say if the deal can be implemented.

"The results are actually remarkably vague and the only positive [is] that there has been agreement at all," says Daniel Gros, director of a Brussels-based think tank, the Center for European Policy Studies.

"More important than the summit has been the speech of Mario Draghi yesterday where the incoming president of the [European Central Bank] indicated that he would continue stabilizing markets and I think that is what markets are reacting to today and not so much the euro-area summit."

 

The summit was also marked by considerable pressure on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to deliver on domestic, structural reforms.

Berlusconi has been widely criticized recently by his colleagues for driving his country toward economic meltdown and he responded by pledging to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2026 and balance the state budget in 2013. 

 

Merkel also made it clear that Brussels and the other member states would enjoy close supervision of Rome's reform efforts in the future.

 

"The Italian authorities have indicated that they all the necessary information will be made available in due time and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi made it absolutely clear that this will be the case," Merkel said.

EU Leaders Struggle To Agree At Eurozone Summit

German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have been helping draft a plan to boost the eurozone rescue fund.

Last updated (GMT/UTC):

26.10.2011 22:01

By Rikard  Jozwiak

BRUSSELS -- It looks increasingly likely that EU leaders have failed to agree on a comprehensive solution to the eurozone crisis during a summit in Brussels that looked set to go into the wee hours of the morning.

But leaders did agree on the bare bones of an agreement, which includes a write-down of Greek debt, the beefing up of the currency zone's 440 billion-euro ($600 billion) rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), and a recapitalization of Europe's banks.

Details about exact figures were vague. 

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk measured his words at a press conference after representatives of the 10 non-eurozone-member states left the remaining 17 to continue a discussion that also is expected to last well into the morning.

"If you ask me whether the eurozone group will agree on everything tonight, then I would be very cautious to say yes," Tusk said.

"I think that we are very close to a comprehensive political deal but a few very important issues may need more time."

Even his Swedish counterpart, Fredrik Reinfeldt, played down hopes that a comprehensive solution would be achieved after the October 26 meeting.

"It should not surprise us that this is technically very difficult.

This is reflecting enormous values.

I think it is better to do it thoroughly in a way which creates long-term confidence in the markets," Reinfeldt said.

"Concerning the political solution, this is better than doing it quickly, therefore it might need more time before the final solution is in place."

Another summit this weekend -- which would be the third in seven days -- has been discussed but it is likely that finance ministers will be left to flesh out the definite text when they meet on November 7.

Finance ministers were initially supposed to meet before the heads of government of the 27 member states to lay the groundwork for a decision but the lack of progress made that meeting superfluous and added to the market jitters. 

'Fine-Tuning' Needed

Although no official numbers have been mentioned it is believed that 90 of Europe's largest banks will have to boost their capital buffers by close to 110 billion euros ($153 billion) in the coming nine months.

The banks are meant to primarily raise money from the markets before turning to bailouts from national governments, with the EU ready to step in as a final resort.

Tusk said that the exact number needed for the bank recapitalization would be agreed first after the other items on the agenda are resolved.

"It cannot function as an independent project without the coming steps we are waiting for," he said.

He said the other items were the Greek write-down and the increased firepower of the EFSF and the three are interlinked.

He added, "The extent of a recapitalization is impossible to know without also fine-tuning the size of private-sector involvement in cutting Greek debt and determine the size of the new size of the EFSF."

The EFSF is able to raise cheap cash for bailouts because of the triple-A credit rating of France and Germany.

So far, it has been used to bail out smaller eurozone countries such as Greece, Ireland, and Portugal.

But it's too small to save larger economies like Italy or Spain, which are both at risk of being sucked into the crisis. 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel won the support of her parliament to strengthen the euro fund after warning in a speech that Europe was facing its most difficult situation since World War II. "If the euro fails, then Europe fails," she said.

Fighting Over 'Haircuts'

EU leaders are attempting to boost the firepower of the EFSF to between 1 trillion and 2 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion-$2.8 trillion) through elaborate financial engineering but the exact number is likely to be established later.

There are two ways to do this that are being discussed.

The first is to turn the fund into an insurance scheme, in which the EFSF could guarantee a certain percentage -- most likely 20 percent -- of fresh debt issues.

The other would be to create a separate fund linked to the EFSF which would raise money from private investors, such as Chinese sovereign-wealth funds.

The biggest question mark, however, concerns the size of the losses, referred to as "haircuts," that the banks must accept for holding Greek debt.

It is clear that it will be much higher than the 21 percent agreed at a previous summit in July. 

Germany and the Netherlands have been pushing for a figure of around 60 percent and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has argued for a figure as high as 75 percent.

France has been pushing hard to keep the number at 40 percent, noting that the country's banks own a large amount of Greek debt.

Paris is backed by the International Institute for Finance, the trade association of the world's banks, which is refusing to budge from a maximum of a 40 percent cut.

It also remains to be seen whether the haircut will be voluntary or forced. 

Berlusconi Under Fire

Ahead of the summit there was also increased pressure on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to deliver on structural changes after receiving severe criticism from fellow eurozone leaders.

Italy has made cuts to public spending but not reformed its recalcitrant economy sufficiently.

On October 26 it appeared that Berlusconi's junior coalition partner, the Northern League, had given up on its objection to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 as long as those who have been working and paying into the pension system for 40 years still will be able to retire.

The move might save Berlusconi for now but fears remain in Brussels that the slow pace of reform still might force Italy to seek a bailout.

Euro divisions "disastrous" - Juncker

The head of the euro zone finance ministers' group has played down the chances of European leaders laying out a detailed plan to save the euro at a summit which began this evening.

Luxembourg Premier Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the group, said leaders were "near the moment of truth", and that tangible decisions had to be taken today.

But the Eurogroup chief added:

"We will likely not set out everything in the finest details but the general direction".

Arriving at the summit this evening, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were still lots of problems to solve and a lot of negotiations ahead, but she was sure that progress would be made.

Also speaking in Brussels, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said he hoped that by the end of the summit, discussions would have progressed to the point where there was "a clear intent" as to how the EU's leadership was going to solve the euro zone crisis.

Their remarks signalled that European leaders were struggling to fulfill their promise to seal a "comprehensive package" to resolve the debt crisis at their second summit in three days.

Euro zone officials were in tense negotiations with banks over how big a hit they should take on their Greek debt holdings.

Officials want banks to accept a 50% to 60% write-down, while the lenders are offering 40%.

The group of big banks negotiating on the issue said today they had made a "significant new offer" to European officials.

European leaders are also unlikely to come up with a headline-grabbing figure in their attempt to boost the firepower of the euro zone's €440 billion rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), diplomats said.

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is also under massive pressure to provide evidence of his willingness to cut his country's massive debt, amid growing worries Italy will be the next victim of the crisis.

Merkel secures Bundestag backing ahead of summit

This afternoon, German deputies voted to give Chancellor Angela Merkel a broad mandate to boost the firepower of the euro zone bail-out fund, hours before the EU summit.

Merkel won the backing of 503 members of the 620-strong Bundestag lower house of parliament, while 89 members rejected it and four abstained.

During the special session Merkel said the euro's weaknesses must be resolved "now or never".

"The fundamental weaknesses and holes in the construction of the economic and monetary union must either be addressed now or, I say, never," she told German MPs. "And if we address them now, then we will have seized the opportunity this crisis presents us. Otherwise we will have failed," she said.

Merkel told the Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament, that resolving the weaknesses of the common currency could only be done via changes to European treaties.

China to invest in EFSF - sources

China has agreed to invest in Europe's bail-out fund, two senior EU diplomats told AFP today.

"China is in," said one of new plans to boost the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) with a spin-off investment vehicle to be used to prop up debt-laden nations.

"But not yet Brazil, Russia, India or South Africa," he added, referring to the four other countries in the BRICS group of emerging powers.

The diplomats gave no indication as to the scale of China's likely investment, although an EU official said EFSF chief executive Klaus Regling would leave for Beijing on Thursday, after the summit.

Asked whether other BRICS countries had formally indicated a similar interest, another diplomat said he was "not aware they have".

The five emerging giants form a key lobby going into a G20 summit on November 3-4 at which the US leads global demands for a lasting European Union solution to the debt crisis that began in Greece nearly two years ago.

"Argentina has said no," the second diplomat said of global talks about designing a new vehicle that would allow EU leaders to leverage up the €440 billion EFSF into a €1 trillion war chest.

The reports on China came as it was announced that the head of the euro zone bail-out fund will visit the country this week.

Klaus Regling, chief executive of the EFSF, will be in the Chinese capital on Friday, the EU delegation in China said in a statement.

The state-owned China Daily newspaper, citing a source close to EU decision makers, said today that China and other top emerging economies had agreed to help euro zone countries by contributing to the bail-out fund.

Leading emerging economies would help to finance the EFSF through the International Monetary Fund, which would boost their voting rights in the Washington-based lender.

The agreement may be written into the final document at the second summit, the unidentified source told the English-language newspaper.

Euro divisions "disastrous" - Juncker

Europe sealed a last-ditch deal today to fix its festering debt crisis, shoring up its bail-out fund, pledging new funds for Greece and pushing banks to share the pain at a summit vital to the health of the global economy.

After days of talks and two successive summits that dragged on for almost 10 hours, EU president Herman Van Rompuy emerged early this morning saying:

"We took important decisions."

Stock markets rallied today after the announcement, while the euro rose as high as $1.42.

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told the European Parliament this morning that the EU would also propose a global financial tax at the coming G20 summit, so that the banking industry would pay for any future crises.

He also said he would ask the EU's Economics Commissioner Olli Rehn to manage the euro.

"Having a commissioner tasked especially with the euro shows that we want euro governance to happen within a communal framework," he said.

"It's fundamentally important but also from a symbolic point of view, and symbols are important," he said.

Rehn's nomination could lead to the creation of the job of euro zone finance minister that has been called for by some European leaders.

Earlier European Council President Herman van Rompuy told the parliament that EU states running excessive deficits must present their annual budgets to the Commission and Ecofin council before submitting them to national parliaments.

He said he would give an interim report on the possibility of limited changes to EU treaties by December, but this was not a short-term priority for fixing the crisis.

Read the key aspects of the Brussels deal here

The last and perhaps toughest chapter in the four-point plan was a deal between euro zone leaders and the Institute of International Finance banking lobby to force private investors to take a 50% loss on Greece's debt .

French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel broke off from the summit to save the day and cut a deal with the head of the banking lobby, Charles Dallara.

"We said it was our last word, our last offer," said Merkel of threats to allow Greece to default failing agreement.

"We have done what needed doing," she said.

The banks in past weeks had raised their offer to 40% but governments insisted on a 50% "haircut".

The deal aims to slice €100 billion off the €350 billion debt pile hampering Greece, which also won new pledges of a €100 billion loan over the next three years.

Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann has said banks made their deal to slash 50% from Greece's debt mountain in order to save Europe.

"All parties have recognised that not only the future of Greece but the future of Europe was at stake," said Ackermann, who chairs the IIF.

Prime Minister George Papandreou, hailed "a new era, a new chapter" for Greece, whose debt woes kicked off a two-year crisis that successively hit Ireland and Portugal before threatening to spill over to the euro area's third and fourth economies, Italy and Spain.

To address that danger, euro zone leaders agreed to boost their debt rescue fund to €1 trillion.

The firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) is to be leveraged up between four- and five-fold using clever financial footwork to avoid governments increasing guarantees.

With the world on tenterhooks, emerging powers China and Russia waded in with offers to help Europe safeguard the global economy by contributing to the fund.

The development came as global powers, from the US to Japan and China, pressed European leaders to come up with a lasting solution to the debt crisis before a G20 summit in France on November 3 and 4.

Europe's leaders agreed two options to boost the EFSF without increasing commitments from member states as taxpayers in countries such as Germany complain about pouring money down what they see as a bottomless hole.

The first option allows the EFSF to provide risk insurance on new debt issued by fragile governments, in a bid to convince investors to continue buying their bonds and keep interest rates low. A second fund, linked to the EFSF, will be created to attract private and public investors, including countries outside the euro zone.

This investment vehicle could also be associated with the International Monetary Fund, an idea Russia has said it prefers.

With fears growing that the debt drama will turn into a banking system meltdown, European leaders also struck a deal to force banks to recapitalise at a summit of the 27-nation EU that preceded the euro zone talks.

"We made good progress on the bank recapitalisation, that wasn't watered down, it now has been agreed," said British Prime Minister David Cameron.

The European Banking Authority said banks would need €106 billion to fulfill the requirements.

Ireland not looking for Greek-style deal

Finance Minister Michael Noonan said the EU summit agreement was a quantum leap towards a solution to the debt crisis, which threatens the survival of the single currency.

He told RTÉ's News at One it was a comprehensive deal that dealt with all the issues, including bank recapitalisation, preventing contagion, a deal for Greece and governance.

Mr Noonan said Ireland's main strategy was to grow its way out of trouble.

He added that Ireland was not looking for a writedown similar to Greece, because Ireland expected to be back in the markets in the second half of 2013.

On the other hand, he said, Greece was looking at least another 10 years of austerity programme and possibly 16 years.

He said Ireland had been successful in a "serial re-negotiation" of aspects of its EU/IMF programme, and while it aimed to reduce the overall burden of the debt, the Government would not touch its sovereign debt.

European Union Reaches Deal On Debt Crisis

Stocks Giving Back Ground After Yesterday's Rally - U.S. Commentary

(RTTNews) - The European Union leaders, who were in intense talks over rescuing Eurozone, have finally reached  an agreement over a number of key issues including the private sector involvement in Greek rescue plan.

Addressing the media after the EU summit in Brussels, EU leaders said that banks have agreed to take a 50 percent loss on Greek debt.

The leaders also decided to leverage the European Financial Stability Facility, or EFSF, by 4-5 times, which is expected to yield around EUR 1 trillion ($1.4 trillion).

They said further co-operation with the International Monetary  Fund will be sought to enhance the EFSF resources.

A new EU-IMF multi-annual program financing up to EUR 100 billion for Greece will be put in place by the end of the year, the EU said in a statement.

Meanwhile reports quoted French President Nicolas Sarkozy as saying that Europe will welcome China's support for the bailout efforts.

EU Works Out 50% Greek Debt Writedown, To Enhance Rescue Fund

10/27/2011 1:24 AM ET

Stocks Giving Back Ground After Yesterday's Rally - U.S. Commentary

(RTTNews) - The leaders of the European Union have finally struck a deal to pull the region out of its worst crisis since the World War II. While persuading Greece's private creditors to take 50 percent of the loss, officials also agreed to enhance the region's rescue fund to EUR 1 trillion.

Addressing the media after the EU summit in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that Greece's private debt holders have agreed to incur a 50 percent loss on holdings of Greek government bonds.

Greece will be subjected to permanent budget supervision by EU.

Euro area member states will contribute to the private sector involvement package up to EUR 30 billion.

Further, a new EU-IMF multi-annual program financing up to EUR 100 billion for Greece will be put in place by the end of the year, the EU said in a statement.

The leaders have also decided to leverage the European Financial Stability Facility, or EFSF, by 4 to 5 times, which is expected to yield around EUR 1 trillion ($1.4 trillion).

They said further co-operation with the International Monetary Fund will be sought to enhance the EFSF resources.

The summit has identified two approaches for the EFSF.

The first one aims at giving credit enhancement to sovereign bonds issued by member states and the second approach proposes the Fund to set up one or several Special Purpose Vehicles to finance its operations.

However, both the French and German leaders noted that the European Central Bank will play no role in guaranteeing the bailout fund's increased firepower.

The summit also approved a co-ordinated scheme to recapitalize banks across Europe.

The ratio of highest quality capital will be increased to 9 percent.

This will enable the banks to withstand shocks important in the current exceptional circumstances, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said.

The confidence boosting measures for the banking sector also included facilitating access to term-funding through a coordinated approach at EU level.

National supervisors must ensure that banks' recapitalization plans do not lead to excess deleveraging, the leaders cautioned.

Meanwhile, the summit called on Italy to present an ambitious timetable for its fiscal reforms "as a matter of urgency."

Italy pledged to achieve a balanced budget by 2013 and a structural budget surplus in 2014, bringing about a reduction in gross government debt to 113 percent of GDP in 2014.

Meanwhile reports quoted Sarkozy as saying that Europe will welcome any support from China for its bailout efforts.

EU Leaders Reach Broad Agreement On Recapitalizing Banks

10/26/2011 7:47 PM ET

Stocks Giving Back Ground After Yesterday's Rally - U.S. Commentary

(RTTNews) - The European leaders meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to find a solution to the eurozone debt crisis have reached a broad agreement on revitalizing banks exposed to debts of Greece and similar crisis-hit member nations.

According to a statement issued after the first round of talks, leaders have agreed to the urgent need for measures to restore confidence in the banking sector "in the context of strengthening prudential control of the EU banking."

The statement said the measures should address the need  to "ensure the medium-term funding of banks" for avoiding  a credit crunch and for safeguarding the flow of credit to the real economy.

The consensus was the measures should also "enhance the quality and quantity of capital of banks to withstand shocks and to demonstrate this enhancement in a reliable and harmonized way."

The leaders also reached a "broad agreement on requiring a significantly higher capital ratio of 9 % of the highest quality capital and after accounting for market valuation of sovereign debt exposures, both as of 30 September 2011, to create a temporary buffer, which is justified by the exceptional circumstances."

Banks have until the end of June 2012 to achieve this quantitative capital target.

They must first use private sources to raise the required funds and then turn to public funds if necessary.

The national governments can provide support to banks if required.

Eurozone banks that does not have government support can fund the recapitalization via a loan from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).

"Any form of public support, whether at a national or EU-level, will be subject to the conditionality of the current special state aid crisis framework, which the Commission has indicated will be applied with the necessary proportionality in view of the systemic character of the crisis," the statement added.

Talks are still continuing to devise a full package that would restore market confidence in eurozone countries that are struggling under the burden of massive sovereign debts.

Some reports quoting officials suggest that the EU leaders have also agreed to raise the eurozone bail out fund to around 1 trillion euros, but are yet to workout how this could be done.

Apart from revitalization of banks and expanding the bailout fund, the discussions are said to have focused on deciding how to bring Greece's massive debts under manageable levels.

Although a 21% write-off of Greek debt is currently on the table, Germany is seeking between 50 and 60%. The European Central Bank is said to have strongly opposed the German proposal.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — With their late-night deal to cut Greece's debt and support other wobbly countries, European leaders bought time to work out more lasting solutions to the crisis plaguing the euro currency bloc.

What they do with that time will determine whether this summit succeeds where many others have failed.

Thursday's three-pronged deal at long last appears to have met or beaten expectations for some kind of decisive action, judging by stock market rallies in Europe and around the world.

It retools the eurozone's underpowered bailout fund, calls on banks to take 50 percent losses on Greek bonds and orders them to raise euro106 billion in new capital by June.

"The summit is likely to be the corner from where the odds start to change in the right direction," said Erik Nielsen , global chief economist at Unicredit .

But European leaders will have to work out the complex financial details quickly and skillfully.

It's unclear whether the bailout fund changes will be enough to prop up Italian and Spanish banks, or whether the bond writedown will be enough to pull Greece from the brink.

Along with that, countries with sluggish economies, particularly Italy, will have to show that they are becoming better places to do business and improving growth — the key to paying down debt in the long run.

So the debt crisis is still far from over.

But with luck the eurozone's 17 governments might get a chance to work on it for a while without fear that a single misstep will take the shared currency over the edge.

The respite could be short if they return to the fudges and procrastination that have so far marked their response to the crisis, which broke out just over two years ago when Greece admitted to the EU statistics agency that its finances were much worse than reported.

Since then, more than a dozen late-night summits and carefully negotiated and crafted statements have failed to get ahead of market fears that Greece would default on its debts and sink the banking system and the wider economy.

The crisis also took down Ireland and Portugal, which like Greece were forced to take a bailout because they couldn't borrow affordably and faced default on maturing bonds.

The hope now is that the trio of measures crafted in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday will give European countries some breathing space within which to focus on getting their economies growing again.

That would help reduce debt and boost confidence in the region's financial markets and banking sectors, reversing what had threatened to be a downward spiral.

The most difficult part of the plan was persuading banks to take 50 percent losses on their Greek bonds to make the country's debt pile small enough for Greece to be capable of repaying it. But even that massive "haircut" might not be enough.

The deal will cut Greek debt to 120 percent of economic output by 2020, from 180 percent otherwise.

Yet debt of more than 100 percent of GDP is still breathtakingly high.

European leaders agreed to push Europe's banks to raise euro106 billion in new capital by June, to protect against losses from the Greek debt writedown.

The money will come from governments if it can't be raised from investors or by selling assets.

The euro440 billion ($610 billion) bailout fund — the European Financial Stability Facility — will be reworked to make its firepower equivalent to around euro1 trillion ($1.39 trillion), to make it better able to help large but wobbly countries such as Italy and Spain.

The EFSF will insure part of the potential losses on the debt of those countries, to relieve fears of default and lower the interest rate investors want.

The spiraling cost of borrowing was what sank smaller Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

Eurozone finance ministers are to work out the terms of the scheme in November, but there are already doubts about how leveraging the bailout fund's limited resources will work.

Joerg Kraemer, the chief economist at Commerzbank, said it was not at all clear that such a guarantee — which essentially admits there are fears of default — will appeal to government bond investors, who typically want safe investments.

And the "voluntary" Greek writedown pushed on banks might convince some potential bond buyers that if there's more trouble, they'll be asked to pony up instead of being compensated through the EFSF's insurance program.

If the EFSF plan isn't enough to magnify its power, wealthier governments such as Germany, France and the Netherlands may have to put more money into it. But with bailouts unpopular in the countries funding them, governments will resist unless the fate of the euro appears once again at stake — meaning back to the brink.

"This alone suggests that the sovereign debt crisis will continue to become exacerbated before ebbing off," said Kraemer.

It's also not clear how long the European Central Bank will continue key purchases of government bonds, keeping borrowing costs down.

The EFSF has the power to do that, but skimpy resources, economists say.

There is always the danger that governments will not properly implement the reforms they have promised.

That has been a sticking point with Greece, which has been reluctant to cut jobs in the public sector, and promises to be an issue in other countries, like Italy, where labor unions are powerful.

Longer-term forces also are making recovery more difficult for the eurozone's weakest members.

Large trade imbalances remain, meaning big surpluses in countries like Germany will create deficits in importing countries like Greece.

Without the safety valve of shifting exchange rates, that is unlikely to change soon.

Despite the host of questions, markets cheered the European leaders' plan.

Stocks surged 5 percent in France and 4.7 percent in Germany, the euro's core where banks are heavily exposed.

Indexes in London and New York also rose substantially.

"Market participants in the U.S. and London are weary of eurozone problems," wrote Stephen Lewis at Monument Securities in London.

"They would have been satisfied with any statement on debt that had enough substance to allow them to move on to fresh themes."

Lewis said Thursday's agreement "fits that bill and buys eurozone leaders more time."

How they use that time is now very much the question.

Merkel Puts Rescue Fund to German Vote Before EU Crisis Summit

(For more on Europe's debt crisis, see {EXT4 <GO>}.)

Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- German lawmakers are set to back a planned increase in the European rescue fund's capacity, removing one hurdle in the path of Chancellor Angela Merkel as she prepares for a summit on tackling the euro-area debt crisis.

Merkel is due to address lower-house lawmakers on the crisis at about noon in Berlin today before the government puts plans to bulk up the 440 billion-euro ($612 billion) backstop to a vote.

The coalition ensured cross-party support after persuading the main opposition Social Democrats and Greens to sign up to a motion that includes a cap on German guarantees.

"This greatly strengthens the negotiating positions of the government and the chancellor" as she heads to the summit in Brussels from the lower house, or Bundestag, Volker Kauder, the floor leader of Merkel's Christian Democratic bloc, told reporters in Berlin yesterday after the CDU caucus met.

German backing to increase the effectiveness of the European Financial Stability Facility is one piece in the crisis-fighting jigsaw puzzle being assembled in Europe's capitals.

Agreement is still missing on how to bolster the EFSF, reductions in Greece's debt load and recapitalizing banks.

The Bundestag is scheduled to vote from about 2 p.m. as it exercises powers over budgetary matters that it won last month after complaints by coalition lawmakers they were being steamrolled into accepting decisions made in Brussels affecting German finances.

"We're all in new territory" as regards the vote, Merkel told reporters yesterday.

ECB Bond-Buying

The motion before parliament lays down guidelines for Merkel to take to Brussels, including a cap on German guarantees at the existing level of 211 billion euros and a request that the budget committee or the full chamber be given another vote after leverage models have been worked up. It also "notes" that there is no need for the European Central Bank's secondary- market bond-buying program to remain in place once the enhanced rescue fund is enacted.

"For us it was a condition that the Bundestag, respecting the central bank's independence, has a clear position:

no more unconditional debt-buying by the ECB," Carsten Schneider, the Social Democratic Party's budget spokesman in parliament, told reporters after a budget committee meeting late yesterday.

Merkel's bloc has 330 seats in the 620-member Bundestag, allowing her to pass legislation with a simple majority of 311 votes with as many as 19 coalition dissenters.

With the help of SPD and Green support, she won a Sept.

29 ballot on enhancements to the EFSF by 523 votes in favor to 85 against.

"We need a simple coalition majority," Klaus-Peter Flosbach, the finance-policy spokesman of Merkel's Christian Democratic bloc in parliament, said in an e-mailed statement.

"I have no doubt that we'll achieve that."

Euro, Stocks

The 17-nation euro gained 0.1 percent to $1.3925 as of 9:33 a.m. in Berlin.

It climbed to as much as $1.3960 yesterday, the highest since Sept.

"We're all in new territory," Merkel said yesterday.

In Italy today, la Repubblica newspaper reported that Berlusconi agreed with Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League party which holds the key to Berlusconi's parliamentary majority, to hold early elections in exchange for a deal on reforms on pensions, liberalization and bureaucracy.

Berlusconi agreed to step down by January and to bring elections forward to March of next year 2012, la Repubblica said.

Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- German lawmakers are set to back a planned increase in the European rescue fund's capacity, strengthening Chancellor Angela Merkel's hand before a Brussels summit that aims to quell the euro-area debt crisis.

With contagion threatening Italy, European leaders are also tightening the screws on Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to bring concrete reforms to today's summit as part of a package of measures needed to stem the risk posed to the global economy.

Merkel will address lawmakers on the crisis at noon in the lower house in Berlin, the Bundestag, before her government puts plans to bulk up the 440 billion-euro ($612 billion) rescue fund to a vote.

The coalition ensured cross-party support after persuading the main opposition Social Democrats and Greens to sign up to a motion that includes a cap on German guarantees.

"The chancellor will travel to Brussels today bolstered by a clear and very broad mandate from the German Bundestag," Peter Altmaier, the deputy parliamentary leader and chief party whip of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, said in an interview on Deutschlandfunk radio.

German backing to increase the effectiveness of the European Financial Stability Facility is just one piece in the crisis-fighting jigsaw puzzle being assembled.

EU Talks With Banks on Greek Bond Losses Said to Be Deadlocked

Cigna 3Q profit falls, but expects 2012 growth 10.28.11

Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- European Union talks with banks on bondholder losses as part of a second Greek rescue package are deadlocked and have been suspended, an EU official said.

The EU is seeking voluntary participation by banks in a second bailout package for Greece, though a forced solution can't be ruled out, the official said in Brussels today on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.

The dispute centers on how much of the risk of any newly issued bonds should be insured, the official said.

At a summit in Brussels later today, EU leaders will try to determine the outlines of what needs to be achieved to prevent Greece defaulting and return it to a sustainable debt load, the official said.

That may involve the EU setting specific limits on its own and International Monetary Fund participation in the second bailout, the official said.

Impasse on Greek Debt Relief Threatens EU Crisis Summit Deal

Cigna 3Q profit falls, but expects 2012 growth 10.28.11

(Adds Merkel, Sarkozy meeting bankers in second paragraph.

For more on the European debt crisis, see EXT4.)

Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- European Union talks with banks on bondholder losses as part of a second Greek bailout ran aground, an EU official said, dimming the chances for a comprehensive crisis-fighting strategy at tonight's summit.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, leaders of Europe's two biggest economies, may step out of the leaders-only summit to meet bankers in an effort to break the deadlock, a person familiar with the discussions said.

"Work's not been done yet, but everyone's coming here today with the goal to progress quite a bit," Merkel told reporters as she arrived for the Brussels summit.

The Greek stalemate darkens the summit's prospects, since a deal struck today on recapitalizing banks and later talks on bolstering the 440 billion-euro ($608 billion) rescue fund hinge on steering debt-laden Greece toward financial health.

While policy makers and bondholders were converging on a 50 percent writedown of Greek debt, clashes over collateral to underpin the transaction will limit the summit to issuing a mandate for further talks, the EU official said in Brussels today on condition of anonymity.

European leaders convened for the second summit in four days -- and the 14th in 21 months -- amid mounting global exasperation over their failure to extinguish the two-year-old crisis that now threatens to ravage Italy and France and brake the world economy.

Stocks Gain

U.S. stocks gained and the euro erased declines on hopes for progress.

The Standard & Poor's 500 Index added 0.9 percent at 3 p.m. in New York.

The euro was little changed at $1.3906.

The outlines of a deal to safeguard banks emerged, centering on a June 30, 2012 deadline for lenders to reach core capital reserves of 9 percent after writing down their sovereign debt holdings, according to a statement after all 27 EU leaders met.

Banks below that target would face "constraints" on paying dividends and awarding bonuses.

The leaders showed little appetite for an EU-run plan, bowing to German calls to make European money available only as a last resort.

Details need to be worked out by EU finance ministers, EU President Herman Van Rompuy said in a statement without announcing when that will be done.

'Full Package'

The bank-aid program "will only go ahead when the other parts of a full package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight," U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters after he left and the heads of euro states continued their deliberations.

Dramas played out across Europe during the day, with Merkel winning a German parliament mandate to negotiate on the rescue fund, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi hustling to prepare new budget cuts and EU representatives jousting with banks over the costs of reviving Greece.

"There is a fatigue on financial markets listening to politicians always coming up with the ultimate, final plan," Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Group in Brussels, said in an interview with Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television.

Euro leaders won't rule out a forced Greek writedown, while continuing to pursue a "voluntary" solution that would scale up a July accord that foresaw 21 percent losses for bondholders, the EU official said.

Bank Lobbying

The Institute of International Finance, which lobbies on behalf of 450 financial firms, sweetened its offer yesterday, proposing to go beyond the 40 percent losses it mooted last week, said two people with knowledge of the talks.

Leaders weighed two options for extending the reach of the fund:

using it to insure bond sales and to finance a special investment vehicle that would court outside money, including from the International Monetary Fund.

Sarkozy plans to call Chinese leader Hu Jintao tomorrow to discuss China contributing, said a person familiar with the matter.

While markets clamor for a signal that the euro area will devote 1 trillion euros or more to combating the crisis, the EU won't be able to produce a number until late November, the EU official said.

To shore up confidence in Italy, Berlusconi came to Brussels with a promise to adopt growth-boosting steps such as increasing the retirement age in stages to 67 by 2026, selling 5 billion euros of state assets over three years and easing labor laws.

ECB Pressure

Italy was under pressure to deliver the reforms to provide a rationale for the European Central Bank to continue supporting the Italian bond market.

Italy's Mario Draghi, set to become ECB president on Nov. 1, said earlier in Rome that the steps are "very important" and "need to be done swiftly."

The cracks in Berlusconi's coalition widened, preventing him from delivering the comprehensive plan to boost growth and trim the debt load.

Newspaper la Repubblica reported that the embattled leader hatched a secret deal to resign in January and hold early elections.

"Either this government is able to take structural reforms or we need another government," Mario Baldassarri, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a former Berlusconi ally, said in an interview in Rome.

"We will see in the next few days or week" whether Berlusconi resigns.

EU Sets 50% Greek Writedown, $1.4 Trillion in Debt-Crisis Fight

Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- European leaders persuaded bondholders to take 50 percent losses on Greek debt and boosted the firepower of the rescue fund to 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion), responding to global pressure to step up the fight against the financial crisis.

Ten hours of brinkmanship at the second crisis summit in four days delivered measures that the euro area's stewards said point the way out of the debt quagmire, even if key details are lacking.

Last-ditch talks with bank representatives led to the debt-relief accord, in an effort to quarantine Greece and prevent speculation against Italy and France from ravaging the euro zone and wreaking global economic havoc.

"The world's attention was on these talks today," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Brussels at about 4:15 a.m. today. "We Europeans showed tonight that we reached the right conclusions."

Measures include a bigger role for the International Monetary Fund, a commitment from Italy to do more to reduce its debt and a signal from leaders that the European Central Bank will maintain bond purchases in the secondary market.

The euro rose and stocks advanced in Asian trading, with the currency advancing 0.5 percent to $1.3975 as of 11:31 a.m. in Tokyo.

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares gained 1 percent, and futures contracts on the U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 Index increased 1.1 percent.

Pressing Banks

Europe's leaders took the unusual step of summoning the banks' representative, Managing Director Charles Dallara of the Institute of International Finance, into the summit to break the deadlock over how to cut Greece's debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020.

Dallara squared off with a group led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel around midnight after issuing an e-mailed statement that "there is no agreement on any element of a deal."

ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, who has warned against the spillover effects of bond writedowns on the banking system, didn't take part in the confrontation with Dallara.

Leaders backed two ways of leveraging up the 440 billion- euro rescue fund, which was designed last year to shield smaller countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, and lacks the heft to protect Italy, the euro area's third-largest economy.

While the mechanics have yet to be worked out, European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said the leverage effect would multiply the power of the fund by a factor of four to five.

Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- European leaders persuaded bondholders to take 50 percent losses on Greek debt and boosted the firepower of the rescue fund to 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion), responding to global pressure to step up the fight against the financial crisis.

Ten hours of brinkmanship at the second crisis summit in four days delivered a plan that the euro area's stewards said points the way out of the debt quagmire, even if key details are lacking.

Measures include recapitalization of European banks, a potentially bigger role for the International Monetary Fund, a commitment from Italy to do more to reduce its debt and a signal from leaders that the European Central Bank will maintain bond purchases in the secondary market.

The euro rose and stocks advanced, with the currency gaining 0.7 percent to $1.4007 at 9:45 a.m. in Brussels.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index surged 2.5 percent and Standard & Poor's 500 Index futures added 1.6 percent.

Cannes Deadline

The summit was the 14th in the 21 months since Europe pledged solidarity with Greece, and came amid mounting global pressure for the bloc to deliver a credible anti-crisis toolkit before a Group of 20 meeting Nov. 3-4 in Cannes, France.

Europe's leaders took the unusual step of summoning the banks' representative, Managing Director Charles Dallara of the Institute of International Finance, into the summit to break the deadlock over how to cut Greece's debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from a forecast of about 170 percent next year.

Dallara squared off with a group led by Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy around midnight after issuing an e- mailed statement that "there is no agreement on any element of a deal."

Insolvency Threat

Sarkozy said the bankers were escorted in "not to negotiate, but to inform them on decisions taken by the 17 and then they themselves went on to think and work on it."

Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said the banks' resistance was broken by a threat "to move toward a scenario of total insolvency of Greece, which would have cost states a lot of money and which would have ruined the banks."

The resulting "voluntary" losses by bondholders were the key plank in a second bailout for Greece, which was awarded 110 billion euros in May 2010 at the outbreak of the crisis.

The new program includes 130 billion euros of official aid, up from 109 billion euros envisioned in July.

The Washington-based IMF, meanwhile, said it is ready to disburse its 2.2 billion-euro share of the next installment of Greece's original bailout.

The release of the euro zone's 5.8 billion-euro share was approved last week.

ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, who has warned against the spillover effects of bond writedowns on the banking system, didn't take part in the confrontation with bankers on the debt relief.

He later praised the leaders' determination to get ahead of the crisis.

Trichet's Call

Tonight's steps "have to be fully implemented, as rapidly and effectively as possible," Trichet, who leaves office Oct. 31, said afterwards.

Leaders tiptoed around the politically independent ECB's broader role in keeping the euro sound, making no mention of its bond-purchase program in a 15-page statement.

The Frankfurt- based central bank has bought 169.5 billion euros in bonds so far, starting with Greece, Ireland and Portugal last year, then extending the coverage to Italy and Spain in August.

EU Tackles Crisis With 50% Greek Writedown, $1.4 Trillion Fund

(For more on the European debt crisis, see EXT4.)

Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- European leaders cajoled bondholders into accepting 50 percent writedowns on Greek debt and boosted their rescue fund's capacity to 1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion) in a crisis-fighting package intended to shield the euro area.

The 17-nation euro and stocks climbed while bond spreads narrowed after leaders emerged early today from a 10-hour summit in Brussels armed with a plan they said points the way out of the quagmire, albeit with some details still to be ironed out.

"Overall the outcome is better than we anticipated one week ago," Laurent Bilke, global head of inflation strategy at Nomura International Plc in London, said in an interview.

"There are several issues left open, but I do believe that getting a more necessary debt relief for Greece is a pretty important step."

Last-ditch talks with bank representatives led to the debt- relief accord, in an effort to quarantine Greece and prevent speculation against Italy and France from ravaging the euro zone and wreaking global economic havoc.

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will address the nation at 8 p.m. in Athens to outline the summit's ramifications for the country at the eye of the two-year sovereign debt crisis.

"The world's attention was on these talks," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Brussels at about 4:15 a.m. "We Europeans showed tonight that we reached the right conclusions."

ECB Role

Measures include recapitalization of European banks, a potentially bigger role for the International Monetary Fund, a commitment from Italy to do more to reduce its debt and a signal from leaders that the European Central Bank will maintain bond purchases in the secondary market.

The euro advanced to a seven-week high against the dollar, rising above $1.40 for the first time since September.

It was at $1.4007 at 11:48 a.m. in Brussels.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index surged 2.6 percent.

"It's long on words, short on detail," said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank AG in London.

"The solution that's been put in place now gives us enough ammunition to stave off any immediate problems but we may well run into other problems down the track."

The summit was the 14th in the 21 months since Europe pledged solidarity with Greece, and came amid mounting global pressure for the bloc to deliver a credible anti-crisis toolkit before a Group of 20 meeting Nov. 3-4 in Cannes, France.

Banks Summoned

EU debt crisis summit begins

Updated:

04:54, Thursday October 27, 2011

A summit of European Union leaders to  thrash out a master plan to fix the eurozone debt crisis has opened  in Brussels.

The gathering of EU presidents and prime ministers is their  second summit in days as markets and world leaders call on them for  a watertight deal to prevent the festering crisis from sparking a  global recession.

The talks are to be followed by a summit later in the day of the  17 EU members that share the euro, which could last well into the  night.

Going into a series of pre-summit meetings, leaders indicated  that a wide-ranging plan was not yet ready.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said "there are still many  problems to settle and negotiations to carry out, so the work is  not yet over".

Acknowledging the summit could fall short of expectations,  Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said:

"We will likely  not set out everything in the finest details, but the general  direction" that must be taken.

Europe's leaders have been scrambling to produce a plan to  shield the euro after two years of turmoil embroiling Greece,  Ireland and Portugal and now threatening the eurozone's third and  fourth economies, Italy and Spain.

Tighter eurozone fiscal discipline is one element in a package  that includes beefing up a rescue fund to guard against further  contagion, agreeing a massive write-off for banks on Greek  government debt, and recapitalising Europe's banks so they can  absorb the hit.

Germans to vote on bigger bailout fund

October 27, 2011

German Chancellor Angel Merkel appears likely to win a parliamentary vote tonight on increasing the euro zone rescue fund with a large majority, bolstering her negotiating strength before a crunch EU summit in Brussels.

Ms Merkel needs to win the vote in the Bundestag lower house of parliament, due tonight, to have a mandate to negotiate a deal with other EU leaders aimed at delivering measures to end the euro zone debt crisis.

The bill will almost certainly pass as the government has agreed to a joint motion on the plans with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens.

"The Chancellor will go to Brussels today strengthened by a clear and very broad mandate," Peter Altmaier, parliamentary floor leader of Merkel's conservative bloc told German radio.

The question is whether Ms Merkel, who still faces a rebellion from within her own centre-right coalition, can pass it without having to rely on the opposition, which would be a severe blow.

A test run held yesterday showed she is likely to win the vote without needing opposition support — but only just.

In the ballot, a total of 16 MPs from Ms Merkel's coalition parties either voted against or abstained.

The proposals, to increase the efficiency of the 440 billion euro ($610 billion) fund without pouring more taxpayers' money into it, are the subject of fierce debate in Europe's largest economy and biggest contributor to the fund.

Ms Merkel is battling sliding ratings for herself and her centre-right coalition over her handling of the euro zone crisis.

Critics at home and abroad have accused her of taking a dithering approach that has exacerbated the debt crisis, and frustration is intense.

Prospects for a comprehensive deal to resolve the euro zone debt crisis at the summit look dim, with disagreement remaining on critical aspects of the potential agreement, including how to give the region's bailout fund greater firepower.

EU officials and European diplomats are lowering expectations of a breakthrough when the 17 euro zone leaders meet, despite Franco-German assurances only weeks ago that a "comprehensive solution" to more than two years of debt and economic turmoil would be found by the end of the month.

"The day of broken promises", German business newspaper Handelsblatt called the summit, highlighting "broken promises" of European leaders and central bankers over four pages.

Ms Merkel's hands have been tied in her negotiations on the euro zone crisis since a Constitutional Court ruling last month demanded a greater say for German MPs on bailout issues.

That ruling has frustrated some EU leaders eager to implement quick solutions.

Even after the summit, Germany's parliament budget committee must meet to discuss the outcome.

On Monday, her conservatives unexpectedly announced the Bundestag lower house would hold a full vote on the new guidelines on the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).

Analysts say Ms Merkel wants to have a large parliamentary majority to gain legitimacy in negotiating for Germany.

Just a month ago, Ms Merkel struggled to contain a rebellion from within her own centre-right coalition in a parliamentary vote on the EFSF.

She was only five votes short of having to rely on opposition support which would have been a major blow, possibly even triggering early elections.

Some rebels who fear the crisis is spiralling out of control are gearing up once again to defy Ms Merkel.

An EU paper, obtained by Reuters, shows two options for increasing the fund's firepower — an insurance model and a special purpose investment vehicle (SPIV) .

Investors hope leaders will tonight decide which of the two approaches should be used, or a combination.

The summit is expected to run late into the night.

Ms Merkel said yesterday that Germany opposed a phrase in the draft summit conclusions urging the ECB to go on buying troubled states' bonds.

The draft seen by Reuters supports a continuation of "non-standard measures in the current exceptional financial market environment".

"This sentence is not agreed with us,"Ms Merkel said, adding that Germany —- a country wedded to central bank independence — did not want a declaration from politicians telling the ECB what to do.

An opposition MP said the German parliament would try to point the ECB in the opposite direction, noting a joint motion between the government and main opposition parties contained the expectation that the ECB would stop its bond purchases on the secondary market.

EU leaders clinch debt crisis deal

AFTER more than eight hours of heated talks that went to the brink of collapse, European leaders yesterday hammered out a financial rescue plan for the euro that they hope will stave off a double-dip recession.

The deal includes creditors reluctantly agreeing to halve Greek debt, a plan to recapitalise the region's banks to protect them against losses and the boosting of the main bailout fund into a €1 trillion ''bazooka''.

The plan aims to quarantine Greece and prevent speculation against Italy, Spain and France from ravaging the euro zone and wreaking global economic havoc.

The crisis had threatened to break up the single currency, which has been the subject of 14 summits in the 18 months since the sovereign debt crisis began.

French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  told reporters in the early hours of yesterday morning (Brussels time):

''Because of the complexity of the issues at stake it took us a full night.

But the results will be a source of huge relief worldwide.''

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said:

''These are exceptional measures for exceptional times … Europe must never again find itself in this situation.''

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said:

''We can claim that a new day has come for Greece, and not only for Greece but also for Europe.''

The crucial element of banks accepting losses on Greek government bonds hit the wall part-way through the Brussels talks, with the banks' negotiator, Charles Dallara of the Institute for International Finance, issuing a statement saying there was ''no agreement on any element of a deal''.

The banks reportedly yielded after Germany  threatened them with  ''the nuclear option'' of Greek bankruptcy.

Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said the banks' resistance was broken by a threat ''to move towards a scenario of total insolvency of Greece, which would have cost states a lot of money and which would have ruined the banks''.

The plan reduces Greece's debt burden by €100 billion ($A134 billion), which means its debts should be 120 per cent of gross domestic product by 2020, down from 160 per cent now.

Banks will be required to raise about €106 billion in new capital by next June.

The fine print on the Greek package would be worked out by the end of the year,  Mr  Barroso said.

European Union finance ministers are expected to decide in November on the detail of measures to increase the size of the bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund.

They include the creation of special purpose investment vehicles to attract money from sovereign wealth funds and other sources.

Mr Sarkozy said he would talk to Chinese President Hu Jintao in the next few days about attracting Chinese investment to the fund.

Euro-zone leaders also demanded Italy take more action on austerity.

Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has promised to raise the retirement age to 67 and take other measures.

British Prime Minister David Cameron was due to leave Brussels for Australia for the Queen's opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth today.

Europe not yet out of woods yet

With the single currency taking a pounding, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy are at odds over a bigger role for the European Central Bank.

IT IS not always easy to be German in a part of the world where the horrors of two world wars are still within living memory.

More than six decades of model citizenship have not yet erased old resentments that, in some quarters, are still  simmering.

So for German Chancellor Angela Merkel to say what she did this week was  remarkable.

She warned that another half-century of peace and prosperity was not to be taken for granted, and that if the euro failed, Europe failed.

She added:

"We have a historical obligation:

to protect by all means Europe's unification process, begun by our forefathers after centuries of hatred and blood spill.

None of us can foresee what the consequences would be if we were to fail."

Just in case readers failed to get the drift, Britain's conservative Daily Mail distilled her comments into a headline that evoked ugly spectres:

"German chancellor warns of war if currency fails."

The newspaper wrote:

"That Germany, the country responsible for two world wars, is raising the prospect of future conflict is a measure of the panic sweeping Europe about the unrest that could follow a collapse of the single currency."

Immediate fears about the future of the euro have eased after this week's historic European summit  -  historic partly because it managed to win any agreement at all -  in which a deal was hammered out that is aimed at solving the financial crisis.

Creditors, mostly banks, have reluctantly agreed to halve Greek debt;

the European bailout fund is to be boosted to €1 trillion ($A1.3 trillion), in case other countries such as Italy or Spain should need to call upon it;

and banks are to raise more capital as a backup for trouble.

Markets bounced back like Tigger on the news, but Europe and its single currency are not yet out of the woods.

Analysts warn the risk of economic apocalypse is less likely for the moment but still possible in the longer term.

If it is to be avoided, the European Union will have to fix the loopholes that allowed this crisis to seed and to fester.

This will probably mean setting up some kind of central oversight of its member-nations' tax regimes, budgets and deficits - a prospect that some leaders might be quietly starting to recognise, but one for which most of their voters back home, proud of cultural identities and national sovereignty, are not at all ready.

Those who manage money call this unifying process "fiscal integration".

British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is among those calling for the EU to accept the "remorseless logic" that having a shared currency makes necessary this second kind of "financial fusion".

Euro-sceptics have long argued the shared currency couldn't work unless members also shared oversight of budgets or a federal budget;

a view the current crisis seems to have borne out.

Europe is now facing a wide range of scenarios about its future, says Thomas Klau, editorial director of the Paris-based European Council on Foreign Relations, "ranging from the catastrophic to the positive".

His vision of the negative extreme echoes Dr Merkel's:

"A disintegration of the euro with consequences ranging from deep depression in the euro zone and beyond to the triggering of a rise in nationalism, xenophobia and aggressive populism, leading to severe instability in the democratic system."

The more positive scenario, he says, is that this crisis, like previous ones, will instead force a major shift towards greater cohesion, "with the countries of the euro currency building something like a federal system to run their economic, budgetary and fiscal policy".

He thinks the second scenario more likely and is sceptical about the idea that it would be stymied by popular anti-EU sentiment in countries such as Germany.

The fear of loss of identity and control have always been big stumbling blocks to union, and the current rescue plan was so long in the making - it took 14 summits over 18 months - partly because many of the decisions had to be taken back to national parliaments for approval.

"There is a difference between voter sentiments and voter behaviour," Mr Klau says.

"Let's look at election results rather than commentary, analysis and opinion polls.

In Germany, voters have voted for parties that are more pro-Europe.

They have strengthened the Greens and the Social Democrats and pushed away the party that was openly supporting Euro-sceptics."

For now, the main question is whether growth will return.

This depends on whether markets will support the rescue deal once the fine print is finalised by the end of the year, or whether they will freeze lending because they get spooked again - most likely by Italy, says  Waltraud Schelkle, a senior lecturer in political economy at the European Institute at the London School of Economics.

Italy's debt is running at 120 per cent of its output.

Dr Schelkle says Italy has sold its sovereign bonds very short-term, which means it will have to refinance regularly:

"So the situation will come again and again, and given the sick state of the economy at large, they will always be situations that could make financial markets nervous."

Her worst-case scenario involves the markets turning against holders of Italian bonds - many of whom are families using them as retirement savings - followed by a run on Italian banks:

"Then, I am afraid, Italy can't be saved [even with the €1 trillion fund].

It's too big. It would be so massive a write-down."

She predicts this scenario would lead to much tougher regulation of capital, with people not able to move money across borders so freely:

"We won't have free markets any more."

Dr Schelkle does not believe the current rescue plan will hold up. She says the European Central Bank must be authorised to step in and buy unlimited quantities of the bonds of troubled countries facing an emergency.

The need for a bigger role for the ECB is a view pushed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.

He has been arguing the case to a resistant Mrs Merkel, who says Germany refuses to accept such "non-standard measures".

Meanwhile, both leaders have mocked Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi;

rolling their eyes when his name was mentioned at a press conference this week.

Mr Berlusconi is struggling to hold his government together while developing austerity measures that pass muster with the EU.

One topic notable for its low profile in public debate is the question of whether Europe's troubled banks should be more tightly regulated.

Many of them need more capital in order to withstand Greece's troubles and whatever might come next.

Dr Schelkle says regulating capital flows is not being discussed because the timing is sensitive.

"You would at the moment make the markets extremely nervous by showing them the torture instruments," she says.

But she believes "it's quite outrageous" that banks' failings pushed the world into recession in 2008-9, made national budgets blow out more severely and led to greater debt, "and then they turned around [to troubled countries] and said, 'You are not a good investment'".

They also had been told from 2002 onwards that Greece was in trouble:

"The financial markets knew bloody well that Greece's budget was dodgy.

It wasn't that they woke up in December 2009 to news they never had. They financed it because no one wants to get out of the bandwagon as long as it runs.

"We left a lot of regulation to banks themselves but they don't understand their own risk models.

Self-regulation left banks to estimate their own risk and obviously they couldn't."

But she, like Mr Klau, believes the euro will survive:

"There is too much invested in it, politically and economically.

The euro will be sacrosanct in the end."

European Union leaders hammered out an agreement early Thursday on debt crisis measures.

The details of a comprehensive policy are meant to solve three main problems:

the debt crisis in Greece, issues generated by the EU bailout fund, as well as banking issues that have been threatening the stability of the euro currency and global economy.

Private sector investors took a 50% loss on Greek bonds, which translates into €100 billion.

This move will ease the country’s debt load to 120% of economic output from 150%.

Under the new agreement, the leaders also agreed on two ways to strengthen the EU bailout fund, commonly known as the European Financial Stability Facility.

The solutions will boost its resources to about €1 trillion.

The EU heads of state also agreed to raise capital requirements for banks that are more likely to be affected by losses on euro-area government bonds.

The goal of the plan, says European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, is to “foster confidence in the European banking sector”.

Banks would have to raise core capital levels to 9% to create a buffer against potential losses.

Beet generation

SIR – The latest proposal to reshape the Common Agricultural Policy is of    interest to the 800 employees at our east London sugar refinery (Comment,    October 13).

Under the proposal, Europe’s sugar beet farmers and processors would be free    to source as much raw material as they wish, at market prices and without    interference from legislation.

That would mean they could produce as much    sugar as they wish.

Our business would continue to be faced with a lack of our raw material – cane    sugar for refining.

The raw material the EU Commission will allow us to buy    at market prices will remain limited to a few supplying countries that    cannot meet demand from Europe.

Our sugar refinery will not be able to    compete with the expansion of beet-sugar production in countries such as    France and Germany.

If we want to buy extra raw material, from outside those suppliers, our only    way will be to pay import duties that double the price of our raw material.

The proposals will kill the cane sugar refining industry, both in Britain and    other parts of Europe.

The EU Commission must allow us to access raw    material on the same terms as them.

We welcome competition, but it must be    on equal terms – not what the EU Commission proposes.

Justice for rioters

SIR – The figures on the rioters, which show that a third had been excluded    from school and two-thirds have special educational needs, should not be a    surprise (report, October 24).

The Coalition now has the opportunity to address issues of social justice that    are inextricably linked to criminal justice.

Those involved in riots must    face the consequences of their actions, but a growing prison population is a    sign of failure, not of strength.

Practical metal thief

SIR – A gas meter, a post to prevent cars entering the car park, plus its    padlock and chain, and a tap, have been stolen from my church (Leading    article, October 25).

Mercifully, the thief turned off the stopcock, so we were spared a flood.

We    now just have a hole in the wall.

Let women stay for port and cigars after dinner

SIR – I was interested to read that Rowan Pelling (Notebook, October 26) was    pleased that after-dinner etiquette meant that she no longer had to leave    the room – as the ladies of Downton Abbey had to.

In the 1990s, when my wife was the only female senior manager in a division of    a multinational company, I attended the directors’ Christmas function, along    with the other spouses of the senior management group.

Towards the end of    the evening, the wife of the vice-president invited the ladies to retire to    an adjacent room while the gentlemen remained at the dinner table for port    and cigars.

My wife ended the evening discussing various forms of soft furnishings whereas    I, a bemused schoolteacher, enjoyed port and cigars, together with a    rollicking from the vice-president on somewhat disappointing sales figures.

SIR – In the most recent episode of Downton Abbey about the happenings on    Armistice Day, the outside views showed all the trees in full leaf.

• German    Chancellor seeks parliament's approval for bail-outs

Latest

23.27 That's it from the Live Blog for today.

Visit the Telegraph    Finance page for the latest on the eurozone debt crisis.

We'll be    back tomorrow to cover a key day in the EU calendar.

21.41 Associate editor Jeremy Warner argues that whatever grand    plan leaders come up with to solve the eurozone debt crisis, it    will create as many problems as it solves . He writes:

Only half in jest is it sometimes said that a better use for Germany’s    money than pouring it down the drain of further bail-outs would be to    sponsor a Greek military coup and solve the problem that way, since    dictatorship is incompatible with EU membership and would therefore    automatically lance the problem.

If only it were limited to Greece.

What is    plain is that the debt crisis is spiralling out of control and may already    have moved beyond the capacity of Europe’s political elite to fix it by    ramming home fiscal and economic union.

21.31 US markets have closed.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished    down 1.74pc at 11,706.62, while the S&P 500 closed down 2pc at    1,229.05. A flurry of downbeat statements including Amazon and UPS sent    markets even lower in after-hours trading.

The Nasdaq Composite is currently down 2.26pc at 2,638.42.

21.17 Events in Europe have overshadowed today's news that US    consumer confidence has plunged to levels not seen since America was in    recession (see 15.15). US business editor Richard Blackden writes:

The anxiety that the survey suggests is gripping American consumers is at    odds with a jump in retail sales last month that economists expected to have    helped the pace of US economic growth quicken to at least 2pc in the third    quarter.

The latest gross domestic product figures are released on Thursday.

20.46 Les    Echos in France quotes the French president as saying:

jamais l'Europe n'a été aussi proche de l'explosion...Europe    has never been so close to the explosion.

Should make for an interesting summit tomorrow.

20.26 Italy's la Repubblica newspaper reports that Umberto    Bossi has said there has been an agreement - but    not on pensions .

20.05 Italy is the elephant in the room because of the size of its    public debt.

At £1.6 trillion - or 120pc of GDP, if Europe's third largest    economy got into a Greek pickle it would simply be too big to save.

As far as pushing reforms through, the Merkozy team haven't exactly    shown much faith in Berlusconi's ability to get this Italian Job    done, as this video which surfaced yesterday shows:

When asked about their conversation with Berlusconi at Sunday's    euro crisis talks in Brussels, Merkozy broke into a smirk that spoke    volumes.

Nicolas Sarkozy finally said:

We have confidence in the sense of responsibility of all of Italy's political,    financial and economic authorities.

19.20 This just in from Reuters.

Umberto Bossi, Italy's Northern League leader who earlier said that "people    would kill us" if they voted to raise the pension age from 65 to 67 has    reached agreement with prime minister Silvio Berlusconi on reforms.

Italy's prime minister Silvio Berlusconi (left) has clashed with    coalition partner Umberto Bossi (right) over pension reform

In the end we have found a way. Now we will see what the EU says.

...Bossi told reporters.

On whether the government will survive, he added:

I remain pessimistic.

19.10 US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ahead of the    eurozone summit:

They [eurozone leaders] are saying a lot of the right things and they’re    clearly working on it and they’re moving with a greater sense of urgency    [...] That’s all welcome, but until we see what they come together with,    it’s a little hard to evaluate.

18.34 Kit Juckes, head of foreign exchange at Societe Generale, offers    his prediction for tomorrow's meeting:

The French word for fudge is caramel.

So is the French word for toffee and for    that matter, for caramel.

Why does a country which practically invented fine    food not differentiate?

Anyway - fudge is what we will get from Belgium at    tomorrow's EU-17 Summit.

The non-Eurozone finance ministers have been sent    packing, the German Bundestag is on-side, and off we go. We'll get a fudge,    sorry, I mean we'll get a deal....

In focus:

Greece's PM George Papandreou addresses reporters after his    meeting with Greece's President Papoulias in Athens today (Photo:

Reuters_.

18.25 This SPIV - you can't make this stuff up, is the second    part of a plan to boost the firepower of the eurozone bail-out fund by    attracting "a broad class of international public and private investors"    such as sovereign wealth funds (or the IMF) to buy eurozone government debt.

Chris Morris, the BBC's Europe correspondent, tweets:

@_ChrisMorris:

I love the fact that a Special Purpose Investment Vehicle may well be part    of the #eurozone solution.

Who could fail to trust a SPIV?

#euro

18.20 Reuters is reporting that the IMF is considering    taking part in a special investment vehicle being proposed by the eurozone    bail-out fund.

It cites an EU official, who said:

The IMF has indicated that they are considering it -- they have not taken a    position [..] It will all depend on the whole package.

17.55 So:

• WE KNOW:

tomorrow's eurozone leaders' summit will go ahead as    planned.

Ministers    are set to arrive at around 5pm Brussels time , hold a working dinner    at 7.15pm, with a statement by European Council President Herman van    Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso shortly    after.

• WE THINK:

details will be few and far between.

Reuters reports that Wednesday's summit is:

unlikely to provide many concrete numbers to flesh out crisis response ideas.

...although its sources suggest that ministers will indicate the losses Greek    debt holders will be expected to take.

Anything between 40pc and 60pc has    been mooted.

• WE HOPE:

that something concrete happens soon.

The last time    leaders met, agreed to agree a deal, then went on holiday, this happened:

The graph shows the FTSE 100 index from July 21 to the end of August.

The index saw a near 1,000 point drop in the two weeks following the July 21    summit as doubts set in over whether the package was comprehensive enough to    tackle the crisis and investors balked at the lack of detail.

Sound familiar?

17.30 This just in from Bruno Waterfield in Brussels.

The reason    why tomorrow's Ecofin meeting was cancelled?

This town wasn't big enough for    the both of them.

He tweets:

@BrunoBrussels:

#eurozone:    EU official notes that as prime ministers of all 27 are there tomorrow "we    don't need finance ministers as well"

17.13 Jean-Claude Juncker (right), who leads the group of euro-area    finance ministers, has said he wants the International Monetary Fund (IMF) included “to the maximum extent” in Europe’s sovereign-debt rescue    plan.

Speaking in Zurich, he said:

We need to take a decision that will answer all questions in a good way [...]    It’s desirable to include the IMF in any European solution to a maximum    extent.

On Greek haircuts, he said:

We’ll need to see what’s the result of a voluntary participation [...] we’re    currently debating 50pc to 60 pc in Europe.

Juncker declined to comment on why the finance ministers' meeting was    cancelled.

17.04 Angus Campbell at Capital Spreads outlines tomorrow's challenges:

The FTSE retreated today as risk aversion crept in ahead of tomorrow’s crucial    European Union summit with some investors just positioning themselves in    case of the worst case scenario.

The job facing European leaders is no small one and can be likened to    climbing Everest without crampons.

In other words a near impossible task to    recapitalise Europe’s banks and prevent a default situation within the sort    of timescale that is rumoured will be announced tomorrow.

17.01 Europe’s markets have closed.

The FTSE 100 in London    finished down 0.41pc at 5,525.54, after trading 1.5pc lower at one point    amid rumours that the EU summit would be cancelled.

The CAC 40 in Paris closed down 1.43pc at 3,174.29, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended down 0.14pc at 6,046.75.

16.40 Our man in Brussels, Bruno Waterfield, sends this update:

It's really messy, corridors resounding with despairing sobs and sound of    tearing hair.

Merkel must give concrete details to her MPs, all that is    conditional on Greek haircuts and bank recap.

But question is can she if    Ecofin has not met to agree on it?

Rumour is that EU is currently demanding 55pc haircut from banks.

A close shave:

A shop owner smooths his hair outside his shop advertising    discounts of up to 70pc on Tuesday as EU leaders prepare to decide on a    'haircut' of the Greek debt in a special summit in Brussels tomorrow (Photo:

EPA).

16.30 Some reaction on Twitter.

Financial reporter Fabrizio Goria tweets:

@FGoria:

No Greek deal,    No EFSF amount, No bank recapitalization amount... So, why there will be an    EZ summit, tomorrow?

@FGoria:

No solution for    this EZ crisis is expected until Martians invasion

While chief business correspondent Louise Armitstead writes:

@louisearmitstead:

Ecofin cancelled.

EU leaders will meet and announce:

we want shock & awe but can't agree it, so over to fin ministers, ad infinitum.

...and Channel 4 News economics editor Faisal Islam says:

@faisalislam:

EFSF = End    For Silvio's Fiefdom .... That's what I think is going on here.

If the    bazooka is meant to save Italy, then Ger/ Fra want him out

16.20 Flashes on the wires are adding more confusion to the mix - and    sending markets even lower.

Here's a taster:

RTRS-EURO ZONE SUMMIT ON WED UNLIKELY TO PROVIDE MANY CONCRETE NUMBERS TO    FLESH OUT CRISIS RESPONSE IDEAS- EURO ZONE OFFICIALS

RTRS-EURO ZONE SUMMIT UNLIKELY TO CLEARLY QUANTIFY NEW, INCREASED FIREPOWER    OF EFSF BAILOUT FUND, COULD INDICATE RANGE-EURO ZONE OFFICIALS

RTRS-EURO ZONE LEADERS UNLIKELY TO ANNOUNCE TOTAL AMOUNT NEEDED FOR    EUROPEAN BANK RECAPITALISATION ON WEDNESDAY-EU OFFICIALS

Well that's a confidence booster.

15.15 Bad economic news from the US - consumer confidence has slipped    to its lowest level since March 2009, when the country was in the midst of    recession.

The Conference Board's sentiment index fell to 39.8 from 46.4 in September,    new figures showed.

That was well below economists' forecasts.

Anxious consumers, reluctant to spend because of a weak jobs markets and    falling house prices, will put a further drag on the US economy.

15.10 George Osborne is getting some praise for his role in pushing    forward the debate on how to recapitalise European banks at Saturday's    meeting.

From Paul Mason of the BBC's Newsnight

One byproduct of no Ecofin is no Osborne chance to influence Euro17    ministers.

I'm told he played a leading role on Sunday.

Followed by the Telegraph's Bruno Waterfield:

He did, they nearly gave up at lunch but he, and Schaeuble, got them going    again.

15.05 If you're shaking your head at this latest delay, consider this    from Steve Hawkes, The Sun's business editor:

Can you imagine how long it would have taken the lifeboats to be launched    off the Titanic if the Eurozone leaders had been in charge..

15.00 And here's a statement from the European Council president, Herman    Van Rompuy:

Ministers of finance may meet in the coming days to fine-tune decisions that    will be taken tomorrow.

There is no new summit planned.

14.55 The EU and eurozone leaders' meetings (all 27 meet first then 17    euro nation leaders go into dinner and make final decision) tomorrow will go    ahead, but what of the bank recapitalisation requirement, which is one of    the three key areas the market is waiting for a decision on?

That was to be    the finance ministers' contribution to the negotiation process.

14.40 BREAKING Following our 13.30 alert that the eurozone    finance ministers meeting tomorrow was looking unlikely, it has now been    cancelled - although the leaders' summit will reportedly still go ahead.

14.35 New York is now open and shares are trading lower:

The Dow Jones slipped 1.4pc to 11,743 points, while the S&P 500 slid 1.7pc.

14.20 Some light relief - and the eurozone's summiteers must feel like    they need it.

Personally, I don't like it as much as Athenian Rhapsody but it's not    bad. Below is a sample and here's the    full version courtesy of the Wall Street Journal.

I Will Delay - sung by Angela Merkel to the tune of Gloria    Gaynor's I Will Survive

First I was angstvoll, I was petrified

Greece looking like defaulting, Ireland on the slide

I spent oh so many years with the euro much too strong

Now it’s not even clear, which countries should belong

And so we’re back

At the Council

With Nicolas, and Enda, and Silvio as well

We should have tightened up the rulebook

For the single currency

If we’d known for just one second

We’d fund this facility

Go on now go, down to Brussels

We’ll fly over and talk some more, while the market sells

They want a big bazooka, a comprehensive fix,

An ECB-backed bailout fund, but we’ll give them nix.

It’s all okay!

We can delay!

14.05 Well Mrs Merkel is the menace of the markets today - after    her comments on not wanting any help from the ECB, shares in Europe started    to turn down, and the futures on the New York market opening are now    pointing lower.

The FTSE 100 is now down 0.5pc, the CAC off 1.3pc in Paris and    the DAX up 0.4pc, compared to a 1.4pc rise at lunchtime.

The Dow    Jones is expected to open down 0.4pc.

13.45 Germany has made it clear once again that it does not see any    kind of expanded role for the European Central Bank in the rescue    measures the eurozone is due to announce tomorrow.

Angela Merkel said the country opposes the statement in the draft    conclusion that calls for the ECB to keep buying government bonds in the    secondary market.

She said Germany does not want a declaration from politicians telling the ECB    what to do.

13.30 Eurozone negotiations are definitely going down to the wire, says Bruno    Waterfield in Brussels.

Poland, which currently holds the EU presidency, has not yet been able to    arrange the meeting of EU finance ministers (Ecofin) for tomorrow, because    the agreement after Saturday's summit was that the next meeting would be    convened once all the missing elements of the rescue plan were put together.

And that has still not happened.

Poland said:

The President of the Ecofin has asked the President of the Eurogroup to be    kept closely informed on when the remaining elements of the package will be    completed.

The finance ministers' meeting may now be pushed to Thursday, Bruno reports,    but the EU leaders' statement on Sunday said Ecofin would be required to put    forward its measures for the banking sector by tomorrow...

13.00 South Africa has just cut its growth forecast for next year    substantially, from 4.1pc to 3.4pc. That is less than half the pace of    growth the government needs to meet its jobs target.

Unemployment in South    Africa is running at 25.7pc.

A slowdown in global growth, driven by fears over the fall-out from the    European debt crisis, has hurt the country's economy, because of lower    demand for natural resources from its mines.

12.40 European markets are still having a rather lacklustre day, with    the exception of the DAX in Germany.

The FTSE 100 is up 0.2pc to 5,560 points, while the CAC is down    0.3pc in Paris but the DAX is up 1.4pc.

The German index was pulled higher by carmakers Daimler and BMW and,    and by Deutsche Bank, which turned in a third-quarter profit and said    it won't need government aid to recapitalise.

11.55 Looking ahead to the US market opening, this is what the futures    market is expecting:

The Dow Jones is set to open lsightly higher, climbing 0.3pc to 11,873    points, while the S&P 500 is expected to rise 0.4pc.

11.30 And more on Italy - which really is becoming the hot potato today    (see 08.45 post).

From Bruno Waterfield again:

dressing down (humiliation) of Italy is 'normal in an economic and    political union', says European Commission.

Silvio Berlusconi's government is under increasing pressure after demands from    Germany and France that he present a firm plan for increasing growth and    cutting borrowing by tomorrow's summit in Brussels.

An emergency cabinet meeting last night ended without a resolution after    coalition members refused to agree to raising the pension age in Italy to    67.

Yields on Italy's government debt have crept back up to almost 6pc, not far    short of levels they reached in August when the European Central Bank    stepped in to cap Rome's borrowing costs by buying Italian bonds in the    market.

Figures out today also showed consumer confidence in Italy has fallen to its    lowest level since July 2008 this month, on concern about the outlook for    the economy.

11.20 And while we were all listening to Sir Mervyn, more news emerging    from the eurozone on the size of losses banks will be expected to take on    Greek debt holdings, one of the key areas for tomorrow's dicsussions.

From Bruno Waterfield in Brussels:

EU wants 60% haircut on Greek debt (50% minimum), banks say anything over    40% is credit event.

'Bring it on," says one official.

10.50 How to endear yourself to an audience - Sir Merv points    out to MPs that he has a flight to catch and refuses to give himself a score    out of 10 for the forecasting record of the Bank of England.

10.40 Angela Monaghan reports that Sir Mervyn King says the squeeze on    incomes could not have been prevented, and that the Bank of England takes    responsibility for not pushing up interest rates.

10.40 The Bank governor is also defending the inflation rate, which it    is his responsibility to control and is running well above the 2pc target at    5.2pc.

From Telegraph commentator Jeremy Warner via Twitter:

Mervyn King:

high inflation is the symptom, not the cause of the squeeze on    living standards.

10.30 Back to Sir Mervyn King at the House of Commons -    controversially, Reuters is reporting that he said whatever is decided at    tomorrow's EU summit will not solve the region's underlying problems - it    will only buy one or two years of breathing space...

He said:

The aim of the measures to be introduced over the next few days is to create a    year or possibly two years breathing space but the underlying problems still    have to be resolved.

President Sarkozy will have a new target for his rage.

10.30 There are also borrowing figures out this morning.

The British    Bankers Association said there was a net repayment of £40m of consumer    credit in September.

Consumers spent £172m on credit cards, but repaid £212m    in peronal loans and overdrafts.

The household savings ratio also climbed to 7.4pc in the second quarter, from    5.9pc in the first quarter.

Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight,    said:

Consumer desire to get a tighter grip on their finances is clearly the    consequence of current heightened concerns over the outlook for the economy    and jobs.

10.20 More from Sir Mervyn.

He explains why the Bank decided to    increase the quantitative easing programme:

When we undertook the next round of asset purchases, we did it because we    thought there were real risks of inflation looking ahead falling below the    target and we wanted to offset that.

10.15 Sir Mervyn King is getting a hard time over how successful    quantitative easing has been in increasing the amount of money available to    small businesses, rather than into the big banks' coffers via purchases of    government bonds.

He says it would have been impossible for the Bank to spend £200bn on    corporate debt.

From Angela again on Twitter:

King appears to be getting increasingly frustrated:

we could not have    bought £200bn of comm paper.

Denies deviating from Treasury wishes.

10.05 Angela Monaghan, economics correspondent, has more from Sir    Mervyn.

He's getting slightly shirty with the MPs questions.

Via Twitter:

King:

we do not just make gestures to look good.

What do you suggest we    should have done?

10.00 Philp Aldrick, our economics editor, is at Parliament today for    the Bank Governor's grilling my MPs. Security has been stepped up for the    occasion, in case of a repeat of the Rupert    Murdoch incident in July.

Phil says.

They've stepped up security in Portcullis House.

All bags have to be    checked in and there are lots of police around, which is very unusual.

Apparently it's because they fear Sir Mervyn will get a foam pie in the    face.

The extra security is only for certain events.

It seems they fear the    Governor has his detractors.

09.55 Sir Mervyn King is now up in front of the Treasury Select    Committee - he's telling MPs that the Bank of England came very close to    voting for asset purchases in September, a month earlier than it happened.

The decision went ahead in October because financial market volatility had not    subsided.

09.35 There has also been a run of banking results out in Europe today.

Germany's Deutsche Bank turned in a €725m profit in the third    quarter, after reporting a loss in the same period last year.

Deutsche scrapped its annual profit target earlier this month as a result of    the European debt crisis.

The bank said today it had €881m of exposure to Greek government debt at    the end of September, and a total of €2.87bn of exposure to the country,    incuding banks and companies.

Deutsche also said it won't need government money under plans taking shape to    recapitalise European banks.

09.30 UK current account deficit figures are out, and they show that    the deficit fell to £2bn in the second quarter of the year, down from £4.1bn    in the first three months of the year.

It's the smallest deficit since the start of the credit crisis in 2008, the    Office for National Statistics said, as the UK made more money from its    investments abroad.

The ONS also revised the first quarter figure down significantly - it was    originally stated as £9.4bn, but revised down to £4.1bn.

09.10 There is quite a bit of UK corporate news around today - BP has turned in its third-quarter results, which are better than expected at    $5.3bn (£3.3bn), although slightly weaker than last year.

The oil giant said it is at a "turning point" after the debacle with    its Russian partners in TNK-BP and the aftermath of the Gulf of Mexico spill    last year.

The shares climbed 4.2pc to 456.45p as a result, lifting the the FTSE 100. BP    is the third most valuable company on the exchange.

08.45 Italy has found itself in the spotlight this week, as huge losses    on Greek debt now look inevitable.

In need of something new to worry about,    Italy's €1.9 trillion of debt has become the focus for investors.

Silvio Berlusconi has come out swinging, telling Mrs Merkel and    President Sarkozy that people who live in glass houses should not throw    stones and that:

Nobody in the union can appoint themselves administrators and speak in the    name of the peoples of Europe.

But the hair dye and Bunga Bunga parties (not to mention the corruption    allegations) have left the Italian leader with a serious image problem.

As    John Micklethwait, editor of The Economist, told Radio 4 this    morning:

Investors simply do not trust this clown of a man to get Italy out of this    mess.

08.05 London trading is now open and the FTSE 100 is flat.

The bluechip index slipped directly after trading started, but settled to    trade up less than 0.1pc at 5,550.5 points.

The lacklustre trading followed    a 1.1pc rise yesterday.

07.50 In the UK today, Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of    England, has been called before the Treasury Select Committee (TSC).

He has    been asked by the MPs to give evidence on the decision by the Bank's    Monetary Policy Committee to start a second round of quantitative easing.

Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the TSC, said:

Among the issues the Committee wants to discuss are the effectiveness of    QE, the case for using the same tool a second time, and the respective roles    of the Treasury and the Bank in implementing measures to stimulate the    economy.

07.40 The business pages of this morning's newspapers have focused on    both Europe and corporate news.

The Times:

BP says deep water ventires may not be worth the risk

The Guardian:

Bankers' pay must be linked to risk, says official

The Financial Times:

Hard line taken with Greek debt holders

07.30 Looking ahead to the market opening in Europe, the FTSE 100 is    expected to open down 0.4pc, while the CAC is also set to fall 0.4pc    in Paris, and the DAX to lose 0.7pc.

07.25 Today is a waiting game in Europe, ahead of tomorrow's summit of    EU leaders - the second in four days.

The issue of bank recapitalisation was    largely tackled at the weekend, with lenders expected to have to raise an    extra €108bn (£94bn).

But the subject of how best to use the €440bn European Financial Stability    Facility (the bail-out fund) and what size of losses private sector    investors should take on Greek debt remain very much under discussion.

In Germany, Angela    Merkel has had to reassure the country's parliament that the eurozone's    richest nation will not be on the hook for paying anything more towards the    EFSF.

The Bundestag must vote in favour of any measures agreed by the    leaders tomorrow.

07.20 In Asia overnight, trading was mixed as markets waited for    tomorrow's EU summit, when a detailed plan on tackling the debt crisis is    finally due to be issued.

Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.9pc to 8,766.75 as exporters struggled in the    face of a strong yen. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.6pc, but    Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.6pc.

Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones finished up 0.9pc at 11,913.62.    The broader S&P 500 rose 1.3pc to 1,254.19, marking the highest    close since August 3, just as Washington was resolving a showdown over    raising the country's borrowing limit.

25 Oct 2011

On agreeing a package of measures

"The banking element is part of a broader package... All participants were    fully aware that the draft annex to this statement concerning the    recapitalisation of banks will work only when the euro area approves other    elements that are currently being debated.

"Bank recapitalisation without the remaining elements, such as the so-called    firewall... wouldn't have any chance of success.

So the statement today is a    pre-condition and it's really an introduction for looking for further    elements in the euro area with greater comfort."

On political agreement

"Bank recapitalisation is an issue concerning all member states.

Everyone with    some minor details... all 27 accept the idea of bank recapitalisation and    this statement.

"If you are asking whether we are expecting that all decisions will be taken    today during the euro area meeting I would be very cautious to make such a    statement.

"I think we are very close to a full political agreement, however there are    some important details that might perhaps require more time.

"It is important, however, that tonight the euro area should demonstrate that    a political agreement has been achieved and the only things that remain are    important, but only technical issues."

British Prime Minister David Cameron

"We made good progress tonight.

It is very much in Britain's interest that we    sort out these problems and solve this crisis.

"We made good progress on the bank recapitalisation.

That wasn't watered down,    it has now been agreed.

It will only go ahead when the other parts of a full    package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight."

Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny

"I understand there has been some progress made in a number of areas, but    clearly leaders of the euro zone will have their own individual points to    put up here.

As I said, the important thing here that the fully flexibility    of the facilities that were approved be used now to bring certainty, and    certainty of intent, for everybody, from both the [European] Council and the    eurozone in particular."

Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann

On haircut for Greek bondholders

"The wish is to come up with a voluntary haircut, I think that is right, but    until that is negotiated we can't announce it. It's still open.

"We always said 40-50 percent is part of the negotiations but we have to be    fair because we don't know what the counterparties would ask for that."

On the European Financial Stability Facility

"The other issue is to improve the way the rescue fund is used.

To make it    strong enough that it would last for a few months or years would be an    elementary step forward.

If we always have to call summits against the    background of a crisis it doesn't create a lot of trust.

"I'm very much in favour of making better use of the rescue fund and giving it    more bearing capacity."

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte

"We need a real solution, we won't buy anything with mediocre compromises.

Some things really need to happen.

"We need today to talk about Greece and ensure that Greek debt is sustainable    and that we're finally finished with this business.

We must talk about the    banks and how they get through this difficult phase.

"We must ensure that this bazooka, the European rescue fund, is strong enough    to show the market that we mean it. We also have to make sure this can't    happen in the future.

We need strong supervision and live up to our    promises."

"We are in this job to take decisions.

It's not easy, but it really has to    happen."

Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme

"I think we will have a solution for Greece.

It is very important to ask for a    voluntary effort by the banks to reduce Greece's debt.

It is also an effort    through the EFSF to make credit accessible at reasonable rates for Greece."

On work ahead

"I think it is work that advances step-by-step.

But the step we are going to    take today or tonight is a very important step toward a total restoration of    the confidence in the euro zone."

"It's an economic union in the making so it does not yet have the firepower it    should have, but we're taking steps forward.

Let's hope for tonight."

On the European Financial Stability Facility

"Let's hope we succeed in giving (the EFSF) enough convincing firepower.

It's    one of the two to three most important points we still have to tackle."

"I think that in effect we would need to be a whole bit above 1,000 billion    euros."

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou

"Our challenge today is not simply to save the euro.

It is to safeguard the    ideas we cherish so much in Europe:

Peace and cooperation amongst our    nations, social cohesion and solidarity without prejudice amongst our    people.

"From our side the Greek people are making a superhuman effort to put our    house in order, to make our economy confident, viable, prosperous and create    a better future for the Greek people, for our country.

"Now is the time for the European leadership to collectively take decisions to    end the uncertainty, end the crisis, turn the page and make sure we make a    big step forward for the better future and prosperity and security of our    peoples in Europe."

Eurogroup President and Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker

On Italy

"Our Italian friends know well that we have to assume that we will be informed    this evening that there will be significant, structural [budget]    consolidation efforts from Italy.

That is a must."

On agreeing decisions

"I think that if we make our decisions in such a way that they work under    pressure, then we will have made the right decisions."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel

"Our challenge today is not simply to save the euro.

It’s to safeguard the    ideals we cherish so much in Europe:

peaceful co-operation among our    nations, social cohesion and solidarity without prejudice amongst our    people."

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou

"What it will be absolutely necessary to do this evening is deal with the key    elements of the eurozone crisis, which is acting as a drag anchor on    recoveries in many other countries, including our own.

"That will require decisive action to deal with the Greek situation and a    proper recapitalisation of the banks, which has not happened across Europe    to date - and the stress tests that have been carried out have not had    credibility - but, above all, it will require the construction of the    firewall of the European fund to prevent contagion elsewhere.

That is the    most important thing."

Eurozone debt crisis:

EU leaders dither over rescue plan

European Union leaders have been accused of failing to address the continent’s    debt crisis as an emergency summit stumbles towards a limited rescue deal    and ducks critical decisions.

Financial Crisis

Eurozone debt crisis:

brutal gamble to let others take the pain

The traditional theatrics of the Justus Lipsius summit building in Brussels    often call to mind the old saying that academic politics are so vicious    because the stakes are so low.

The Times:

If euro fails, then Europe fails

23.32 This just in from Bruno Waterfield, in Brussels:

Summit suspended.

Merkel, Sarkozy, Lagarde, and Van Rompuy in meeting with the    IIF bankers - "make or break"

He adds on Twitter:

@BrunoBrussels:

eurozone:    Banks and the IIF plutocrats One, Merkozy and #EU governments Nil. Who is in    charge?

It's time to make them pony up

22.55 The lead negotiator for private holders of Greek debt has said    that there has been no agreement on the amount they are willing to    write-off.

There has been no agreement on any Greek deal or a specific "haircut"    [...] We remain open to a dialogue in search of a voluntary agreement.

There    is no agreement on any element of a deal.

...Charles Dallara said in a statement.

Failure to agree on a voluntary writedown or "haircut" could lead to    a fullscale Greek default.

That would be bad news.

Last Tuesday, Greek PM George Papandreou said his government was    struggling to save Greece from default.

22.33 The European    Banking Authority (EBA) has issued a statement on the bank recapitalisation    plans outlined earlier (see 21.45).

It puts the recapitalisation bill at €106bn (£92.3m), but    says this figure will be finalised next month.

Greece and Spain need to do the most work, while seven    countries, including the UK, do not need to raise more capital to    meet the requirements, according to EBA flash estimates.

Flags flutter in front of the headquarters of La Caixa in Barcelona.

According to the EBA, Spanish banks would need to raise €26.2bn to meet the    new capital requirements (Photo:

Reuters).

22.14 Completing our quad of faces is Richard Blackden, far from    the madding crowd at the Buttonwood    Gathering of economists in New York.

He writes:

More than 3,000 miles from the summit in Brussels, The Economist magazine is    hosting its annual Buttonwood Conference in New York.

It's one of those    two-day summits that give policymakers a chance to make the case for action    or inaction, executives to either speak their minds or say nothing and    economists be thought provoking - if they can manage it.

Gene Sperling, one of President Barack Obama's key economic advisers, has    just given an impassioned defence of the administration's $447bn Jobs Bill.

But as Sperling spoke it was hard not come away with the feeling that the    best compromise for the US economy will be a victim of two fiercely    competing political narratives over the next 12 months.

The next test case for Washington's ability to compromise will be the    bipartisan commission which has to come up with a deficit-cutting package by    the end of November.

August's debt ceiling deal, which created the    commission, managed to neither reverse the worrying projection for America's    long-term debt or provide any short-term fiscal stimulus for the economy.

The pressure on the bipartisan commission is on, and the world is clearly    hungry for politicians to beat expectations.

22.00 Still no sign of a press conference in Brussels, where, according    to Sky News, on the dinner menu tonight is roast turbot with spinach,    and a trio of sorbets.

Yum.

Bruno Waterfield, our man on the ground, writes:

No news of pressers here.

Deeply boring and depressing - hoping to see a    paper draft soon.

I can give a nerdy update on the EFSF - but I feel like    weeping with the tedium as I write it.

21.54 While International Business Editor Ambrose Evans-Pritchard says Europe's    grand gamble risks failure without the European Central Bank :

Europe's "Grand Plan" to save monetary union is, in broad terms,    a settled matter, even if the usual theatrics were still dragging on into    the small hours of the Belgian night.

Whether it proves any more successful than past efforts over the past two    years is far from clear.

The package is a huge gamble.

If it goes wrong, it    may accelerate contagion to core Europe, hastening the denouement so feared    by EU leaders

21.45 More from chief business correspondent Louise Armitstead,    who writes that eurozone banks have    been given just eight months to raise €100bn :

The deadline was one of the few concrete resolutions to be agreed at the    crucial debt crisis summit in Brussels [...}

In a move that could unsettle global markets, the leaders failed to produce    the promised "ambitious and comprehensive response" to the debt    crisis, instead settling for a raft of compromises.

The underwhelming denouement came after a day of high drama in which Angela    Merkel, the German Chancellor, said politicians had "now or never"    to save the euro.

She even warned the political stability of Europe was at    stake.

21.38 Jumping the gun, perhaps?

This from the European Parliament on    Twitter:

We await the press conference to tell us what the outcomes are.

21.31 US markets closed strongly as traders, boosted by French-China    talks finished with a flutter.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 1.4pc to close at 11,869.04,    while the S&P 500 finished up 1pc at 1,242.

21.18 US Business editor Richard Blackden is mixing with Monetary    Policy Committee member Adam Posen and other economic    heavyweights at a New York conference entitled A world unbalanced.

He    tweets:

@RichardBlackden:

David    Bonderman (founding partner of TPG Capital) says Europe doesn't care about    growth.

Period. "the Italians care that the plumber can take August off    and go to Sardinia."

@RichardBlackden:

Gene    Sperling (director of the National Economic Council) quips it's a shame that    we 'prevented another Great Depression' can't fit on a bumper sticker.

Would    that help Obama now?

21.04 We also know that if you're 35+, male, and still living with your    parents, you probably caused this mess.

20.35 So far, the evening has brought us a draft leaked statement from    eurozone leaders, a final statement from Europe's leaders, a letter from Silvio    Berlusconi promising much and a night, that if rumours are to be    believed, promises little.

Here's what we do know:

• Europe's leaders have agreed a plan to recapitalise Europe's    banks.

Lenders will need to increase their cushions of capital so they have    a 9pc core tier 1 capital ratio - boosting the amount of capital banks hold    compared with risky investments.

• Italy has agreed to raise its retirement age from 65 to 67 by    2026.

Other reforms will see it raise €5bn over three years through selling    state assets.

• Rumours are flying around like flies.

Reuters says the    eurozone bail-out fund will be leveraged to €1 trillion, while reports on Bloomberg and Reuters say French President Nicolas Sarkozy is ready    to pick up the phone to Chinese President Hu Jintao tomorrow to    discuss SPIVs (see 18.55 for explanation of SPIVs) - aka contributing    to a special fund that would help the eurozone out of its current pickle.

20.32 While Sky's economics editor Ed Conway has just said his    sources have told him talks could "go on for days".

Bruno Waterfield in Brussels doesn't sound hopeful either:

@BrunoBrussels:

The    #eurozone deal is clearly going to be an underwhelming, deceitful amalgam of    banker maths and fuzzy EU pieties

20.15 Reuters is reporting that eurozone leaders intend to boost    the region's European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), to around €1    trillion.

It says:

"The ratio of the leverage will be of at least 4 times," one source    said, while another said the spare capacity available to be leveraged was €250bn to €275bn (after amounts are set aside for aid to Greece, Ireland and    Portugal and for the recapitalising the region's banks)

20.00 So, although hard numbers were few and far between in the EU-27    statement, banks will be required to increase their core Tier 1 capital    ratio to 9pc of assets by the end of next June.

This is 2pc higher and seven years earlier than under Basel III.

19.40 European Council President Herman    Van Rompuy has also issued a statement . He said:

The consensus concerns both the banks' short-term and longer-term needs.

The overarching goal of the exercise is to foster confidence in the European    banking sector.

Improved access of the banks' medium- and long-term funding    is essential to avoid a credit crunch and to safeguard the flow of credit to    the real economy.

States will provide guarantees enabling banks to raise    term funds.

We decided to rely on a truly coordinated approach at EU level    regarding the conditions and criteria.

19.30 Read    the EU-27 statement here (that's Cameron and Merkozy and co, Not    Merkozy and co).

19.20 So there's been a deal to recapitalise the banks - more details    as we get them.

While that's been happening, Italy's Prime Minister Silvio    Berlusconi has released his long awaited letter to the EU on    Italy's budget plans.

Confirming    earlier reports in Italian newspapers :

• Italy will increase the pension age from 65 to 67 from 2026.

• It will raise €5bn through privatisation plans over three years.

This will be finalised by the end of November.

• It will ease job protection measures by May 2012.

Hopefully now the EU can fill in those blanks in its draft statement.

Raising    the pension age to 67 will bring Italy in line with France and Germany.

Still going strong:

19.16 From the eurozone to Europe.

Prime Minister David Cameron has been speaking after the EU-27 leaders' meeting.

He said:

We made good progress tonight.

It is very much in Britain's interest that    we sort out these problems and solve this crisis [...] We made good progress    on the bank recapitalisation.

That wasn't watered down, it has now been    agreed.

It will only go ahead when the other parts of a full package go    ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight.

18.55 Other lines dropping on the wires from the draft eurozone statement    are:

• The eurozone plans to leverage its bail-out fund "several fold"    - with "several fold" to become a concrete number in November.

• SPIVs rule.

The bail-out fund will be used to partly insure debt, and to    attract private and international public investors through a "special    investment vehicle" (SPIV or SPV).

• The bail-out fund could balloon even further post-November.

Also, the IMF    will add its own bullets to the bail-out armoury.

• As Peter Spiegel (see below) mentions, Spain was given special    praise, though the statement says more needs to be done

• Greece was labelled "exceptional and unique".

Not a    compliment.

18.46 Bruno Waterfield, in Brussels says "Italy" is blank    because the eurozone is waiting for Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi to    present this famed letter to them, which, according to reports, will contain    a pension age increase from 65 to 67, €5bn privatisation and an austerity    czar/taskforce.

18.41 Interesting, though not surprising    post from the FT's Peter Spiegel . He's spotted an interesting    omission from the eurozone leaders' draft document (12.25) circulated    earlier today.

He writes:

After a long section praising Spain for reducing its budget deficit,    restructuring its banks, reforming its labour markets and adopting a    constitutional balanced budget amendment is a blank section just labelled ‘Italy’.

So far, there’s nothing in the section.

Clearly, the eurozone    leaders are still undecided whether efforts Silvio Berlusconi has made to    date are enough to warrant the same praise as Madrid.

18.26 Oh ye of little faith.

A few highlights on Twitter re:

this    evening's summit:

@PIMCO:

Gross: This is no    summit.

It’s a coffee klatch filled with petit fours and empty promises.

@davidmwessel:

All    purpose headline.

Can be used daily.

"@WSJEconomy: Europe Still Split    On Crisis Packag http://on.wsj.com/rKrn9x"

@FGoria:

The questions    are:

who will buy Italian state assets?

Who will buy Italian BTP?

18.15 Credit markets followed equity markets today with a lacklustre    performance.

Borrowing costs across Europe largely fell, with yields on ten    year German, French, Italian and Spanish bonds    all edging down.

It was also relatively quiet in the credit insurance markets, although the    price of insuring Italian debt against default ticked up by 4 basis    points to 457bp.

This means it now costs £457,000 to insure £10m of Italian debt.

This compares with £86,000 for German debt, and £189,000 for French.

Gavan Nolan, at Markit credit research, said:

Today’s trading session was always destined to be the calm before the storm    and so it proved.

Flows were light as the markets waited the outcome of the    EU summit held after the close.

18.00 Back to where it all started - Greece, where defence minister Panos    Beglitis and deputy infrastructure minister Yiannis Magriotis,    were confronted by protesters shouting abuse during a celebration mass.

Responding to the protesters, Mr Beglitis said:

we are going through difficult times as a country but we should realise    that we are all responsible for its future

17.48 Lucio Malan, from Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom    Party is up next.

On the Italian people's reaction to Italy's austerity    measures, he says:

We didn’t have an especially negative reaction – of course people want to    have more money and less taxes but most Italian people understand we need to    do what is needed in order to keep Italy safe.

And in a jibe at French President Nicolas Sarkozy, he said:

We accept advice, but not such gestures as Sarkozy as given.

The aggregated    debt of France is the same as ours, so we have no lessons to learn from them.

17:43 Former Labour Chancellor Alastair Darling has told the BBC    that members should be locked in tonight if necesasry to come up with an    answer:

It's not hopeless, but Greece is not going to be able to service its debts,    which is why a default is likely.

Tonight they must come up with a solution    and look the doors if necessary to sort it out. The last thing Europe needs    is a disorderly breakdown of the Euro.

George Osborne has had to annouce an increase in expected borrowing because    growth has slowed.

If you don't have growth you won't get the deficit down,    it's simple.

17.30 You can follow a live    streams from Brussels on the EU Council's website.

17.19 It's the schmooze before the storm in Brussels, with leaders    gathering for the first working session using the first twenty minutes to    say their hellos.

Greek PM George Papandreou is speaking with his Danish and Italian    counterparts Thorning Schmidt and Silvio Berlusconi, while David    Cameron speaks with Finland's PM Jyrki Katainen.

Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel also head to the meeting room    together.

The usual suspects?

Leaders arrive in Brussels.

Clockwise, from top left:

Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi, British PM David Cameron, IMF head Christine    Lagarde, Greek PM George Papandreou, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and    European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso

17:05 Deputy Political Editor James Kirkup asks whether today    will come    to mark the end of an era :

Ah, Europe.

Whatever else you say about it, there's no challenging the    continent's place in history.

It may be unpardonably Western-centric and    culturally insensitive to say it, but this is where civilisation began.

The    planet's dominant culture and political settlement (free markets, free    votes, the rule of law, separation of powers) is, in essence, European,    albeit a European culture pumped up on American steroids then splattered    around the planet by modern technology.

Why think about this today?

Well, I think there's a good argument for    suggesting that we're approaching one of those epochal moment when the sun    sets on one era and rises on another.

17.01 While we’ve been star watching – EU government style – Europe’s    markets have closed.

The FTSE 100 index in London finished up 0.5pc at 5,553.24, while the CAC    40 in Paris finished little changed at 3,169.62 and the DAX 30 in    Frankfurt ended the day down 0.5pc at 6,016.07.

16:55 Silvio Berlusconi arrives fashionably late as usual, with seven    minutes to spare before the summit starts.

He doesn't seem to be in the mood    to answer questions, perhaps considering the Italian news reports that he    will resign by the New Year in order to push through important reforms.

16:45 International Business Editor Ambrose Evans Pritchard says    today's summit is quite a remarkable moment.

He writes that never before – to his knowledge – has    a national parliament demanded and held a prior vote on an EU summit    accord.

Had this principle been established a long time ago, we might have avoided    much of the relentless Treaty creep and EU aggrandizement advanced by secret    deals at the Bâtiment Justus Lipsius.

Thank you Germany.

Thank you too, judges of the Verfassungsgericht, for giving the Bundestag a    veto on EU encroachments on fiscal sovereignty.

The court is seemingly the    only tribunal willing and able to defend the liberties of European citizens    against EU over-reach, and is therefore my supreme court too even as a    British citizen.

Dr Merkel has won her vote.

She secured an "own majority" for    proposals to leverage the €440bn bail-out fund (EFSF) into the stratosphere,    with the support of some very sheepish looking law-makers from posturing    Free Democrats and Bavaria’s Social Christians.

But what a price she paid.

The credibility of her team is shattered.

Europe    has all but destroyed her, even if she manages to limp on to the next crisis.

16:38 Looking to the markets, the euro is plunging against other    currencies as European leaders and banks appear deadlocked over how much of    Greece's debt should be forgiven.

16:35 Greek PM George Papandreou is the latest to arrive,    and gives an earnest address to gathered press:

"The Greek people are    making a superhuman effort to put our house in order and make our economy    viable and prosperous.

Now is the time for the EU leadership, collectively,    to end the uncertainty and crisis and turn the page."

16:14 French Premier Nicolas Sarkozy has just arrived,    but uncharacteristically, has declined to speak to journalists.

16:18 Laura Kunessburg, ITV Business Editor on the Brussels red carpet,    says a new draft of deals has just been circulated - and she's told it has "virtually    nothing" in it on the size of writedown for private investors.

16:12 Luxembourg prime minister and Eurogroup chief Jean-Claude    Juncker arrived a little while ago, telling reporters:

We have to take resilient decisions today.

It probably won't be possible to    formulate every issue to the very last detail, but the overall direction has    to be ultra-clear by tonight.

16:08 Scenes now of leaders arriving at the summit in Brussels.

Cameron is one of the first, briefly stopping to talk to press, saying:

"It is    in British interests to solve this crisis and what we will talk about    this afternoon relates to Britain."

16.00 It looks like the Greek debt write-down is going to be the    biggest problem.

From Bruno Waterfield in Brussels:

German officials are pessimistic that talks with banks will deliver the 50pc    headline haircut figure needed for a convincing deal.

15.50 It's like the Oscars - they're all arriving, but hopefully    thinking about more than what they're wearing.

Courtesy of Laura    Kuenssberg on Twitter:

Christine Lagarde says there is a lot of will to get a deal done, and Mrs    Merkel says "the work is not done".

15.45 The leaders are now arriving - and the lobbying is getting more    persistent.

ITV's Laura Kuenssberg tweets:

Leaders starting to arrive for summit - officials pushing line that there    will be a a deal - the question is what is in it

15:42 Perhaps the most vital indicator:

Our correspondent in Brussels, Bruno    Waterfield, has it from bookmakers Paddy Power that the odds on a euro    break-up by 2015 are 6/5.

15:40 Lord Owen, former British foreign secretary, has just told Sky    News:

"Fortunately we didn't have a Eurozone when I was in the job and    I wouldn't have accepted one. It is a flawed project... as it is currently    designed it will fail."

15:35 The issue of the EU is seen to be one of Left vs Right in    domestic politics.

Author and Left-wing thinker, Owen Jones, writes    on political blog Labour List that as it stands, the EU is seen as that    perennial obsession of the Tory right-wing fringes:

the sort of issue that    excites only bigoted, Daily Mail-reading Little Englanders.

The Left    must find its voice on the EU, Jones says:

To begin with, Labour activists have to acknowledge that strong hostility    to aspects of the EU – if not the entire project – is widespread.

It is not    confined to the lunatic fringes.

A stronger argument would be that – during    an economic crisis which is destroying jobs and living standards – voters    have far more pressing issues to worry about.

We have to accept that there are real grievances about democracy that have    to be addressed.

The EU is now a source of huge amounts of unaccountable    power in Britain.

All real democrats should argue that power is only    legitimate when it is accountable.

The largely toothless European Parliament can either accept or veto a slate    of Commissioners put to it – but their source of power can hardly be said to    be the European people, most of whom wouldn’t be able to name a single    Commissioner if pressed.

15.15 Back to those Greek haircuts - during her address earlier today, Chancellor    Merkel told German MPs the goal for Greece is to reduce the country's    debt to GDP ratio to 120pc by 2020.

What does that mean for the banks?

Bruno Waterfield reports:

Under scenarios put forward by Greece's 'troika' of lenders - the European    Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund - that    would mean a 50pc writedown for private sector bondholders.

Which is better than the 70-75pc the IMF is looking for, according to earlier    reoprts...

15.10 It's journalism's equivalent of towels on deckchairs - Wall    Street Journal correspondent Matina Stevis can't get near the    doors of the hall where EU leaders will meet for German camermen.

She    tweets:

Trying to get in position at the doorstep for EU leaders' arrivals made    incredibly difficult by aggresive German TV crews.

Elbows in action.

14.58 Ed Miliband, who was earlier called a "complete mug" by Cameron for not wanting to reclaim powers back from the EU, has just tweeted:

@ed_miliband What we need    from this afternoon’s European Summit is an agenda to help Europe and    Britain’s economy to grow and create jobs.

14.45 And back to the serious stuff - Bloomberg is reporting    that talks have stalled over one of the key negotiating areas for    this evening's summit - the size of losses on Greek debt which banks will    have to suffer.

Yes, those famous haircuts.

As a result "involuntary" losses for banks on Greek government debt    cannot be ruled out, the news agency said.

14.40 A little bit of eurozone humour from Paul Mason, BBC    Newsnight's economics editor.

Playing on this fine newspaper's work with a    thermal imaging camera at the St Paul's Cathedral protest camp, he tweets:

I have thermal imaged Justus Lipsius building in Brussels and can confirm    no Euro bailout deal in there at moment.

14.35 Wall Street is now open for the day, and markets are climbing    strongly after yesterday's declines.

The Dow Jones is up 1.1pc to 11,831.16 points, while the S&P 500 added 0.9pc.

14.20 BREAKING German MPs have voted in favour of using the money in    the bail-out fund (the EFSF) as a form of insurance for loans taken out by    nations.

The Bundestag also backed Chancellor Merkel's opposition to using money    from the European Central Bank to increase the size of the EFSF.

14.15 Meanwhile, somewhere else in Brussels, the European Parliament    has just voted through a nice budget increase for itself.

According to Open Europe, MEPs votes for a 5.2pc increase in the 2012 EU    budget.

Some 431 were in favour, 120 against ,and with 124 abstentions.

And setting a great example for Greece & Italy to follow when it comes to    austerity!

Marina Yannakoudakis, Conservative MEP for London Region, who voted for    a pay freeze, had this to say:

When the rest of world is forced to make cuts, for Europe to demand more    and more taxpayers' money is economic madness.

I am doing all I can to fight for a budget freeze.

Unfortunately it seems    the majority of MEPs want to press ahead to build an ever-bigger European    bureaucracy and to protect their own salaries and benefits - and they have    no shame over sending ordinary taxpayers the bill.

14.00 The US markets are opening shortly, and are set to open higher:

Futures on the Dow Jones are pointing up 0.9pc to 11,771, while the S&P    500 is expected to climb 0.9pc too.

13:50 After three hours of protracted debate, the German Parliament is    now on voting on the EFSF enlargement.

It has been predicted that Angela    Merkel is set to win majority support for the planned increase in scope of the bail-out fund.

13:35 Tensions over the tough economic reform programme have proved a    little too much for a pair of Italian deputies, who just started a brawl in    parliament.

Two deputies from the Northern League, a member of the ruling centre-right    coalition, fought with members from the opposition FLI party speaker Gianfranco    Fini, grabbing each other by the throat as other parliamentarians rushed    to separate them.

The sitting was suspended for a while after the fight, which broke out because    of sarcastic remarks on television by Fini alleging that the wife of League    leader Umberto Bossi (pictured below) had retired at 39.

It was only last year tempers flared in the lower house of parliament in Rome    with one MP calling an opponent "a piece of ----" before several    ended up wih black eyes.

13.25 Louise Armitstead gives us an update from Germany, where debate    in the Bundestag is still going on after Merkel's speech and no vote has yet    been cast:

German vote update:

Bundestag debate is still going, Merkel being    absolutely shredded, accused of misleading taxpayers etc. Punchy stuff.

13.05 Wow - the IMF wants Greek bondhlders to take losses of as much    as 75pc on some of their loans to the country, Dow Jones is    reporting.

No more detail yet, other than that they are getting the information from an    EU official.

12.55 The Telegraph now has a copy of the draft agreement on    recapitlaising European banks.

See 12.25 post for details, which    includes

Banks should first use private sources of capital, including through    restructuring and conversion of debt to equity instruments.

Banks should be subject to constraints regarding the distribution of    dividends and bonus payments until the target has been attained.

If necessary, national governments should provide support, and if this    support is not available, recapitalisation should be funded via a loan from    the EFSF in the case of Eurozone countries.

12.40 As details of the bank recapitalisation plans emerge, countries    are moving to say they are not the ones with a problem.

Italy's banks are in a position to rise to the "new challenge" of    recapitalisation if necessary, according to Mario Draghi, the head of    the Bank of Italy and, as of next week, president of the European Central    Bank.

"Italian banks are in a position to respond to this new challenge,"    Draghi said.

Most Italian banks increased their reserves at the start of the    year under pressure from the central bank, which is "confident"    they will do so again if necessary.

12.35 The details of the bank bail-outs may have surfaced, but there's    no details on Greece yet - because they haven't been agreed, Louise    Armitstead reports.

She tweets:

Meanwhile in Brussels, reportedly no concl between officials and private    sector bondholders.

Means Greek bail-out will be incomplete too.

12.25 Details from the draft agreement for this afternoon's summit are    now dripping out - European banks will be told to:

- Seek capital from the markets first and the bail-out fund only as a last    resort.

- Be subject to constraints on their dividend and bonus payments until they    meet capital targets -groans from investors and bankers alike.

- Sustain a tier one capital ratio of 9pc by June 2012.

Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal gives his view of these    moves:

Recipe for credit crunch.

12. 20 Back in Blightly, a game of verbal tennis is going on at Prime    Ministers Questions, between David Cameron and Opposition    leader Ed Miliband over the EU referendum:

Miliband:

We need immediate action for growth, not all these long-term    plans.

We also have a case of a prime minister and deputy prime minister    contradicting each other on key issues, who's in charge?

Cameron:

Coalition agreement talks about rebalancing powers.

We have    already achieved the bailout power back that your party gave away.

Miliband:

The PM has been too busy sorting out problems from within his    own side and has been distracted by backbench revolts to think about    short-term plans from growth in the country.

Cameron:

The real split we have here is not in our party but between    the Right Honourable Gentleman and reality.

When asked if he wanted to join    the Euro last year he said "it depends how long I'm PM for."

Miliband:

We have a PM who has spent the last week pleading...not    leading.

12.10 And naturally, the financial transaction tax gets a    mention - Merkel has said she will aim to get the tax agreed at the G20    meeting in November.

More popular than persuading your parliament to sign up    to bailing out other countries...

12.05 And after saying there will be no more money, the German    Chancellor puts the frighteners on. Dow Jones newswires reports that Mrs    Merkel said:

No-one should take another 50 years of peace in Europe for granted

11:45 Downing Street has said David Cameron changed his travel    arrangements to be in Brussels today (he was due to be visiting Japan And    New Zeland on the way to Oz) because he wanted to "feed in"    Britain's views at the summit.

Asked whether there would need to be further EU meetings to finalise details    of the rescue package, a spokeswoman replied:

"Who knows?

We know that    there are difficult issues.

We are under no illusions about that."

The spokeswoman suggested the G20 summit in Cannes on November 3 and 4 was the    deadline for a deal:

"There needs to be a package in place certainly by    the G20 meeting next week," she said.

11:40 Telegraph commentator Toby Young believes the European    project was doomed    from the start and the collapse of the Eurozone crisis talks is a    perfect illustration of just how misguided the idea was:

The reason the talks have broken down is that the leaders of the Eurozone    are too limited in their room for manoeuvre by the domestic politics of    their home countries.

If those countries were single party states and their leaders dictators – as they were at various points in the case of Germany, France, Italy, Spain,    Portugal, Greece, Austria, Estonia, Slovakia and Slovenia – closer political    integration might at least be a possibility.

But given that all 17 nation states that make up the Eurozone are liberal    democracies, not to mention the additional 10 countries that sit alongside    them in the EU, the chances of them ever agreeing on a common fiscal and    economic policy are vanishing to zero.

11.40 One indication of a long night ahead.

From Bruno Waterfield in Brussels:

'I have a clean shirt and 2 bananas to get me through tonight' says diplomat

11.35 A few more lines are coming out of Merkel's address to the    Bundestag - she says EU treaties must be changed as the bail-out becomes    more comprehensive.

She also says both possible models for expanding the    EFSF will be examined tonight.

However - whatever is decided on the EFSF, Germany won't be putting more money    into the fund, the German Chancellor confirmed.

11.30 Telegraph commentator Jeremy Warner is also    listening in to Mrs merkel's address to German politicians.

He tweets:

#Merkel rules out use of the #ECB to provide more liquidity to sovereign    debt markets in her speech to the #Bundestag

11.25 And more from Germany - Chancellor Merkel says Greece    needs "permanent monitoring".

From Louise Armistead:

Merkel says we must "respect" Greek ppl but says 3 month troika    reports not enough - need "permanent monitoring" of Greek economy.

Achtung.

11.25 The European Commission is adding pressure to the situation.

Bruno    Waterfield tweets:

Commission 'we need credible political answers to key questions tonight'

11.20 Here is a longer quote from Merkel:

Three years ago, the insolvency of Lehman's bank helped cause a financial    crash, which led later to a crisis.

We here in the German Parliament    prevented a deep recession.

We have asked a lot of the German people to be    patient, and we came through the other end.

It's clear that Germany can't do well if Europe doesn't.

It is therefore    important that Europe emerges from the crisis stronger than it went into it.

11.20 The Telegraph's Louise Armitstead is following    Chancellor Angela Merkel's address to the Bundestag now. She tweets:

Merkel says challenges facing Europe are "daunting".

But there    are "positives" in developments of Ireland and Portugal.

Merkel starts speech with reminder of strength if Ger econ after shoring up    system post Lehman Bros.

BUT warns Ger econ relies on EU econ.

11:10 Greek daily morning paper Kathimerini is reporting that    Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos has presented Greek    bankers with a plan for a 50pc writedown of state debt with cash payments as    the main incentive.

For every 100 euros of Greek debt, private investors would be given 15 euros    in cash and 35 euros in 30-year-bonds with a six-percent voucher, although    the ratio of cash and bonds could change, the daily said, citing unnamed    sources in Brussels.

11:05 Sky News economics editor Ed Conway says Europe has    had to resort to Anglo-Saxon    capitalism to save itself.

He quotes Nicolas Sarkozy as saying in 2009:

“I want the world to see    the victory of the European model, which has nothing to do with the excesses    of financial capitalism.” He poured scorn on the complex financial    structures Americans had relied on to slice up their debt, disguise it as    something more attractive and sell it on to credulous investors.

Conway    says:

How ironic, then, that it looks highly likely that the “solution” Sarkozy    and his fellow Eurozone leaders are shambling their way towards (and there    seems to be an ever-decreasing likelihood that we’ll see a decisive plan    emerge tonight) is bound up in precisely the kind of financial complexity he    was criticising two years ago.

I’m talking, of course, about the European Financial Stability Facility – the bail-out fund which underpins the efforts to save the single currency    (for the other parts of the plan, see my previous blog).

The EFSF is a vehicle which, back in July 21, was given authority to help    troubled euro nations.

It’s funded by guarantees from euro members worth    around €780bn, although only €440bn of this is of AAA quality and can,    itself, borrow in the secondary market.

.

11.00 Bruno Waterfield reports from Brussels that a draft agreeement is    already circulating in Brussels:

#eurozone draft agreement given to EU permanent reps/ambassadors in sealed    envelopes this morning

10.50 Italy has successfully sold €10bn of short-term government debt    this morning, although it had to pay the highest interest rates for more    than three years to do so.

The country sold €8bn of six-month bonds at an interest rate of 3.5pc, the    highest since September 2008, when the market was rocked by collapse of    Lehman Brothers.

Italy also sold €2bn of two-year bonds at a yield of 4.6pc, the highest since    June 2008.

10.40 With Europe's press and politicians descending on Brussels, here    is a handy linguistic guide from Financial News commentator William    Wright:

Just in case we don't get a big bazooka at summit today, the German for    'peashooter' is 'ein Pusterohr' and the French is 'une sarbacane'

10.30 The BBC's Robert Peston asks why    haven't markets melted down?

And why are we not seeing a wholesale    withdrawal of vital finance from Europe's banks?

Well, whether it's cold logic or hot naivete, investors are persuaded that    eurozone leaders will ultimately do the right thing - and that the direction    of travel to a solution is clear.

That confidence could evaporate if the political crisis in Italy makes it    less likely that there will be early moves in that country to reduce the    massive burden of its public-sector debt by shrinking the state:

in those    circumstances German legislators will be hugely reluctant to use the German    balance sheet to provide emergency loans to Italy;

Germany won't want to    throw good money after bad.

Even so, Germany's lower house of parliament is expected later today to    give Mrs Merkel the authority to approve an increase in the financial    firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility - presumably because    they have been persuaded that the consequences of doing otherwise would    rebound painfully on their country and economy.

Robert Peston also says the success or otherwise of tonight's crunch    eurozone negotations comes down to Germany.

Oh, and he also says there won't be a "comprehensive and ambitous response",    as promised by France and Germany last week, on the table by the end of    today...

There will be no stability for the eurozone without the bailout fund, the    EFSF, having the resources to do its vital job of demonstrating to the world    that there's no possibility of Italy or Spain going bust - or at least not    for a year or two, during which Spain and Italy ought to be able to mend    their finances.

And, right now, there is no certainty Germany will give the necessary    underwriting to the EFSF, so that it will have big enough boots to bash up    speculators betting on the collapse of Italy and Spain.

10.25 The Northern League, part of Italy's ruling coalition, has also    denied that a deal has been struck for Silvio Berlusconi to step down    in January.

Still peculiar that two Italian newspapers are reporting the    same story - see 09.45 post - that he is...

10.20 The debt-reduction plan Italy is presenting in Brussels today    includes raising the retirement age for women, my colleague Louise    Armitstead reports.

She tweets:

The Italian austerity deal incls raising retirement age for women from 65    to 67. Small fry in face of Italy's €1.9trillion debt pile.

10.15 What does the market really want from today's eurozone summit?

According to John Kay in the Financial Times:

The decisive action they seek is not really a European solution at all. It    is that the German government should write very large cheques - or    underwrite very large borrowings.

10.10 Closer to home for a second, The Sun has discovered that Vince    Cable, the Business Secretary, has been fined by the tax authorities for    failing to pay as much as £25,000 in VAT on his earnings from lucrative book    deals and media appearances.

Whither HMRC's cmapign to clamp down on freelancers who don't pay their taxes?

10.07 The great and good of British journalism are all on their way to    Brussels for tonight's crunch meeting - Jon Snow of Channel 4 News    laments the slightly tatty state of the Eurostar - a metaphor for what's    happening to the continent's economy?

He tweets:

On a decaying Eurostar, no electric sockets, no internet, jaded seats..pity    'cos it's a fab service and great staff

10:05 More bad news for Italy - Italian business confidence has fallen    this month to the lowest since January of last year amid concern that    austerity measures and Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will weigh on economic    growth.

The manufacturing-sentiment index dropped to 94, from 94.5, Rome-based    national statistics institute Istat said today.

Economists had predicted a    reading of 94, according to the median of 14 estimates in a Bloomberg    survey.

10.00 Ambrose Evans-Pritchard explains how the political is massively    getting in the way of the economic imperitive as this crisis reaches its    peak.

In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a tense vote in the Bundestag after    narrowly surviving such an ordeal in September, this time over plans to    leverage the EFSF to €1.4 trillion.

Once again there is a risk that a backbench revolt will force her to rely    on the opposition Left to carry the vote, undermining her grip on power.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy also told an Élysée breakfast    meeting held behind closed doors that "Europe has never been so close    to explosion".

09.45 Conflicting reports on Silvio Berlusconi now coming in -    the Italian prime minister's office has denied he will step down in January    2012.

But Nick Squires, the Telegraph's Rome correspondent, has more    from the Italian press on the "secret pact" to resign in December    or January that has reportedly been agreed by Berlusconi and his coaltion    partner Umberto Bossi of the Northern League.

The embattled prime minister made the deal with his key coalition ally,    Umberto Bossi of the devolutionist Northern League, in return for Mr Bossi's    support for pension reforms, according to unconfirmed reports in two Italian    newspapers - La Repubblica and La Stampa.

Italy is under huge pressure from the European Union to reform its pensions    system and extend retirement ages as part of a plan to rein in its enormous    public debt and revive its moribund economy.

Mr Berlusconi reached agreement on Tuesday night with Mr Bossi and will    present a pension reform plan to the EU at a crucial meeting in Brussels    today.

"Don't make a fool of me in Brussels, and I promise that we'll go to    elections in March," Mr Berlusconi told the Northern League leader,    according to La Repubblica.

09.35 China is also taking on an increasingly prominent role in the    eurozone crisis - the head of the EFSF, Klaus Regling, is is off to    Beijing on Friday.

As mentioned in the 08.40 post, plans to expand the bail-out fund by    tacking on a special investment vehicle which can sell debt and raise money    to buy up government bonds and offer loans will require the investment of    nations with a budget surplus - like China.

China Daily, the state-owned newspaper, is reporting today that China    and other big emerging economies had agreed to contribute to the EFSF    bail-out fund.

09:30 Domestic rows over Britain's EU referendum are also heating up    today.

Tory MP Greg Hands has been called up on what his Labour rival calls "outrageous    political hypocrisy" following the referendum debate this    week.

New government whip Mr Hands was the Commons "teller" for MPs who    voted against having a referendum to determine Britain's future membership    of the EU.

However, Labour MP Andy Slaughter has highlighted a campaign called "I    want a Referendum" which Mr Hands lent his name to in 2008.

David Cameron suffered the worst Tory rebellion of his time in office when 79    of the party's backbenchers voted in favour of a referendum on Monday night.

09:25 Jeremy Warner, assistant editor of The Telegraph, warns today    that whatever grand plan leaders come up with to solve the eurozone debt    crisis, it    will create as many problems as it solves.

So far the Coalition government has gone along with Europe’s pained march    towards fiscal union, even though this runs counter to the eurosceptic    instincts of its Conservative hierarchy.

There are, essentially, two justifications for their approach.

One is that    the apparent alternative of disorderly default and break-up would almost    certainly plunge Europe, and very possibly the rest of the world too, into    prolonged depression.

Whatever satisfaction those such as William Hague    derive from being proved right about the folly of monetary union, it cannot    be in our economic interests to see the project end in catastrophe.

Ergo,    they must support what in opposition would have been anathema – ever closer    union.

09.15 ITV's Laura Kuenssberg reports via Twitter that there is a    14-page document from Italy going round Brussels now, outlining its planned    spending cuts - but no more news on any of the other main issues to be    negotiated later (see 07.50 post).

09.05 The news that Silvio Berlusconi has agreed to setp down in    January (see 08.20 post) has prompted a fair bit of excitement on    Twitter - a couple of examples:

@catherine_mayer Just saw an Italian friend dance the #BungaBunga at news #Berlusconi agrees    to stand down.

"He shamed me. He shamed Italy" says friend

@gsmokeyjoe #r4today reporting that Silvio #Berlusconi gonna stand down early ?!?    first of the rats leaving the sinking ship maybe?

09:01 Former British chancellor Norman Lamont has warned this    morning of "great dangers" with the possibility of a haircut for    Greece.

He also claimed some countries would fail to ever become "fully    competitive" in the future, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme:

There's a very important aspect of this and that is something called    credit default swaps - the insurance policies that are taken out to    safeguard people, insure people, against default by sovereign authorities    like Greece.

One of the dangers of the haircut that is being proposed is that a severe    haircut will cause a credit event and will trigger credit default swaps and    will therefore affect banks who hold those credit default swaps.

I personally think the long-term future of the euro will be argued about    for some time to come because the strains there are so immense I don't    believe that the southern Mediterranean countries in the long run can ever    really become fully competitive.

Lord Lamont says some countries would fail to ever become "fully    competitive".

08.40 The International Monetary Fund is considering taking part    in the bail-out fund via a special investment vehicle (SPIV), Reuters    reported.

The

To increase the firepower of the €440bn EFSF without actually putting more    money into it, the SPIV (try not to laugh at the name) will be able to issue    debt and use the money raised to buy the bonds of indebted nations in the    secondary markets, or make loans to governments.

The SPIV would be able to raise money from private investors and sovereign    wealth funds, and the IMF could also contribute.

Of course, when the IMF is involved, it means British taxpayers are on the    hook because of the country's contribution to the fund.

08.30 The Daily Telegraph's Benedict Brogan says David    Cameron will be flying in to Brussels this afternoon, in time for the    leaders' meeting at 4pm, and that talks are expected to go on all night.

He    will then be whisked away by his waiting plane to Australia, for the    Commonwealth Heads of Government conference.

The PM may not be in Brussels too late, however - after Nicolas Sarkozy's    angry reaction to Britain's contribution to Europe at Sunday's summit, the    leaders of non-euro nations may not be asked to stick around.

08.20 Italy is very much to the fore again - the government is hanging    by a thread.

Italian newspaper Repubblica is reporting that Silvio    Berlusconi has agreed to resign by January in exchange for agreement    from his coaltion partners on reform of pensions and government bureaucracy.

Italy, which has €1.9 trillion (£1.65 trillion) of debt, will try to sell €10.5bn of government bonds today, even as it races to come up with a    credible debt-reduction plan in time for today's summit in Brussels.

Obviously if Italy is without a leader, or can't get agreement on debt    reduction, it will make getting a final agreement at this afternoon's    meeting all the harder - it is the eurozone's third-largest economy after    all...

08.00 The London market is now open and traders appear to be    sitting on their hands:

The FTSE 100 traded flat, up less than 0.1pc at 5,525 points shortly    after opening.

07.50 My colleague Szu Chan has put together a    round-up of the main issues the EU and eurozone leaders will be trying    to thrash out today.

The even-more edited version is this:

there are three    key issues which markets need details on.

1) The bail-out fund:

how can the €440bn European Financial Stability    Facility (EFSF) best be used?

Who will pay to expand it?

2) What size of loss, or 'haircut', will banks have to take on their    holdings of Greek debt to get that country's borrowings back on a more    stable footing?

3) How much money do banks need to raise to shore up their balance    sheets once these losses on Greek debt (and possible write-downs on the    bonds of other indebted nations) have been acocunted for?

Which banks does    this affect and where will they raise the money from - governments or the    market?

07.30 Well, here it is - D-Day for Europe's leaders and another day of    waiting for the markets - the politicians will be thrashing out the final    details over dinner so there won't be any final announcement until after    markets close.

Here is the timetable as we have it, using London time - Brussels is an    hour ahead.

•11.00 - Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses the German    parliament to get backing for rescue plans

•16.15 - EU leaders start to arrive, speak to the press

•17.00 - All 27 EU leaders sit down to discuss euro rescue

•18.15 - The 17 eurozone leaders start a working dinner.

European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, and European    Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, will announce the results of    the meeting once it ends.

According to Bruno Waterfield, our Brussels correspondent, French    reporters are bringing fresh underwear to work today on the expectation they    will be in for a long day...

07.20 The newspapers have chosen to lead with the turmoil in Europe on    their front pages as well as business pages.

The Times:

Europe at mercy of the markets as Italy teeters

The Guardian:

Indecision day:

wrangles on euro bailout spook markets

The Financial Times:

Italy coalition in fight for life

07.15 Trading in Asia overnight has been muted, with most of the major    indices trading flat ahead of this evening's key announcement of a plan to    solve the European debt crisis.

The Japanese Nikkei was off less than 0.1pc at 8757.09, while the Hang    Seng added 0.3pc in Hong Kong and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose    0.4pc.

Barclays Capital said in a note:

The cacophony of voices, shifting timelines and complexity of the problem    lead us to remain cautious on the euro and risky assets until more about the    next steps is known.

In the US yesterday, shares fell after gloomy news on US consumer confidence    and uncertainties over Europe.

The Dow Jones lost 1.7pc to 11,706 points, while the broader S&P    500 declined 2pc.

EU summit deal on eurozone debt crisis:

Eurozone leaders said on Thursday they had reached agreement after late-night    talks on measures to tackle the debt crisis.

The deal calls for banks to    accept a 50pc losses on Greek debt and increases the firepower of the rescue    fund to about €1 trillion.

This is how analysts, expects and politicians    reacted:

The deal on deeper private sector participation in Greece emerged after Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel personally engaged in the negotiations with bankers.

EU rescue rescue document is one giant leap for the eurozone

European leaders may have laboured until 4am - or 14 summits now, if you're    counting - but their agreement was derided as spiritless, even by Brussels'    standards.

As European leaders meet this week, they continue to twiddle their fingers as the risk of an enormous global financial crisis caused by Europeâ€™s crisis increases.

The Eurozone faces critical jssues borne of their inability to properly construct a functional economic union, and the problems they have created will require aggressive and bold solutions.

European citizens and their leaders face no choice but to ensure an orderly default for Greece, effectively guarantee the debts of all other Eurozone countries, and recapitalize European banks;

the alternative is almost certain to be economic chaos and recession.

Europeans have constructed their economic union in a few stages.

First, the Europeans had an integrated market, a wise idea that broke down trade and immigration barriers and increased economic activity by allowing the free movement of goods and peoples.

This market strengthened over time and led to a society that maintained distinct cultures and governments but shared economic markets and a set of admirable fundamental rights.

They should have stopped there.

Instead, many of the EU member states went ahead and created a currency union.

The flaw in their plan was that fiscal and monetary policy must go hand in hand;

it is impossible to run a properly functioning monetary union without also having integrated fiscal policy.

We can see the ramifications of the Europeansâ€™ decision right now:

Countries like Greece, Italy and Spain would traditionally use substantial inflation to devalue their debts, but instead they are subject to a tight monetary policy that better suits the stronger European economies such as Germany and Austria.

If Europeans donâ€™t find a way to manage an orderly default for Greece, protect other at-risk Eurozone economies, and recapitalize European banks, they could start a global economic crisis that would make the 2008 financial crisis look like a warm-up act. Taken as a single entity, the EU is the worldâ€™s largest economy . A chaotic default by Greece, or even worse, defaults by Spain or Italy, could send the European economy into a tailspin, and it would bring the rest of the global economy down with it.

Europeans must immediately arrange an orderly debt restructuring (partial default) for Greece.

This will entail reducing Greeceâ€™s debt burden to a manageable level by forcing bondholders to take substantial haircuts, or debt-for-equity swaps, on their holdings of Greek debt.

Greece is almost certain to default at this point, and the only question is whether it will do so in a chaotic or orderly fashion.

It is essential it is done in a methodological manner to minimize the effects on other European economies as well as the larger global economy.

Forcing bondholders to take substantial haircuts on Greek debt will understandably result in major losses for banks.

European member states and the European Central Bank must together commit to support the banks through a combination of recapitalization measures and unlimited lending facilities.

Member states seem to have agreed to a preliminary set of recapitalization measures, but any that donâ€™t include unlimited lending facilities wonâ€™t go far enough to ensure trust in the European financial system.

It is never pleasant to bailout large banks, but given the large sovereign debt holdings of most European banks, the alternative could be a string of disastrous bank failures.

Finally, European member states must ensure that none of the other Eurozone economies default.

This requires a commitment to â€œ open-ended financing â€� from the ECB to every other European economy.

The ECB must commit to buying all bonds of European countries for the foreseeable future as well as engaging in more expansionary monetary policy.

A strong commitment to financing will remove investor concern that these countries wonâ€™t be able to pay off their debts, while a more expansionary monetary policy will devalue the nominal debts and make it easier for countries to pay them off.

Instead of committing to this right now, the Eurozone is convinced that a leveraged fund , the European Financial Stability Fund, should be put together to buy European bonds.

Yet its hard to believe that a complex, leveraged, and limited vehicle for bond purchases subject to electoral approval by every single Eurozone member state will really be more effective than an ECB that can just print the Euros necessary to finance the debt of member states.

It is puzzling that European leaders and Mario Draghi, the chair of the ECB, are not committing to debt purchases of all at-risk EU sovereign debt.

Europeans have not committed to the bold measures that are needed to prevent disaster because, to quote Matthew Yglesias â€™03, they are uncomfortable with being fully â€œon the hookâ€� for problems arising in any European member state.

By joining the currency union, however, Europeans committed themselves to integrated fiscal and economic governance.

They now have no choice to continue on this path if they want to avoid a string of defaults, bank failures, and crises that would leave Europe and the rest of the global economy in tatters.

EU Makes Deal on Greece Debt

Is this the end of the Greek debt crisis?

The European Union reportedly reached a major agreement late Wednesday.

The â€œthree-prongedâ€� deal involves banks taking a 50 percent loss on the nationâ€™s debts.

The write-down will apply to private bondholders on their Greek debt.

The plan will in turn reduce Greeceâ€™s debt and give more loansâ€”also helping Europe avoid a market meltdown.

European Union president Herman Van Rompuy said the euro zone and the IMF, which have keeping Greece afloat, will pump â‚¬100 billion into the country.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the decision will â€œrelieve the whole world.â€� Negotiations at the euro-zone summit were stalled over this â€œ haircut â€� for bondholders.

EU Reaches Tentative Debt Deal

European Union leaders reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday to tamp down the mushrooming debt crisisâ€”but some analysts said the lack of real details could spell trouble with banks.

According to early versions of the agreement, banks will need to hold 9 percent of capital reserves and will also need to raise $139 billion by the end of June 2012.

A statement released by the European heads of state participating in the euro-zone debt talks says that â€œa truly coordinated approach at the EU level is needed regarding entry criteria, pricing and conditions" for banks.

Although the road to Wednesdayâ€™s summit has been rockyâ€”financial leaders canceled a meeting set to be held Tuesdayâ€” German Chancellor Angela Merkel won a key victory for the bailout expansion in her countryâ€™s Parliament.

Merkel:

No More German Bailout Money Coming

Type Size:

By HOWARD SCHNEIDER and MICHAEL BIRNBAUM, The Washington Post

October 26, 2011

German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her parliament ahead of a key vote on Wednesday that deep changes must be made to Europe’s economy if the euro is to hold together as currency.

But she offered few concrete details about the steps she will take to protect it.

The lingering uncertainty underlines the likelihood that a major summit planned in Brussels later on Wednesday will fall short of achieving the comprehensive plan that Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy had promised earlier this month.

“We need to act together jointly,” Merkel said Wednesday.

“It’s not possible to have a simple solution.

We will have to deal with this situation for years. . .We have a historical obligation to fulfill.”

But underlining how many issues remain unresolved, Merkel said that she would not commit any more Germany money to supporting Europe.

She called for private investors to make a “large contribution” to ease Greece’s debts .

European leaders have been frustrated in their efforts to craft a response to the continent’s debt crisis by Wednesday’s self-imposed deadline.

In Italy, meanwhile, a political stalemate in Italy over austerity measures has further diminished hopes for a quick resolution.

As top European officials return to Brussels for their second summit this week on the crisis, they are sending conflicting signals about how much progress they have made on key elements of a rescue plan.

Still unsettled on Tuesday were how best to use the limited resources of a European bailout fund to help cash-strapped governments such as Greece and Italy, and how much of a loss private investors such as banks should take on their holdings of Greek bonds, which have lost much of their market value.

Adding to the uncertainty, finance ministers from euro-zone countries canceled a meeting without public explanation, deferring critical decisions to the summit of government chiefs.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Tuesday that only clear, detailed steps would help convince global investors that Europe can contain its problems, which are rooted in high levels of government borrowing and have threatened to undermine the region’s banking system.

The debt crisis is taking a toll on Europe’s economy and could trip up the recovery in the United States.

After days of intense deliberation and high-level meetings, European leaders have agreed on the broad outlines of a plan but may be weeks from filling in the specifics.

“We want to see, like the world wants to see . . . the details, not just the objectives,” Geithner said as he visited a factory in North Carolina.

Geithner has joined senior officials from China and other economic powers in pressuring the 17-nation euro currency region for a more forceful plan to shore up its banks, a financing plan for embattled Greece, and a guarantee that the governments of large countries such as Italy and Spain will be able to borrow money at affordable rates.

If their borrowing costs jump, these countries may face default, and Europe would be hard-pressed to come up with enough money to bail them out.

European leaders have promised a convincing plan.

But tangled politics within European countries and bickering among the nations have put such a plan in jeopardy.

And the recent debate has underscored tensions between European economic powers such as Britain that don’t use the euro and the 17-nation currency bloc.

In Italy, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi averted an immediate government crisis hours before the summit with an overnight deal with a major party on emergency growth measures demanded by the European Union.

Berlusconi and Northern League leader Umberto Bossi reached a compromise on raising Italy’s pension age in late-night talks Tuesday, the Associated Press reported.

Berlusconi will deliver a letter with Italy’s measures to the summit later Wednesday.

In Greece, negotiations with private investors over possible losses on their Greek bond holdings were underway — a sticking point that must be resolved before euro-zone leaders can develop a long-term financing plan for the nation.

In a televised address, Prime Minister George Papandreou said he hoped the crisis triggered by overspending in his nation would reach a turning point Wednesday.

European officials are requesting that private bondholders take losses as high as 60 percent, arguing that Greece will never stabilize its economy without steep concessions from creditors.

“Tomorrow we want to be able to turn the page, so that we, as Europe and as a country, can move forward,” Papandreou said.

Evidence of an economic slowdown across the continent has complicated the debate as officials try to balance conflicting priorities.

High levels of government debt demand budget cuts, but that can damage economic growth.

Greece needs debt relief, but that could hurt banks that are already clamping down on lending.

Meanwhile, measures to increase the power of a regional bailout fund have lacked details.

A document describing the measures from the euro-zone working group was submitted to the German Parliament for review this week, and it hints at how far European leaders must go before they can adopt rules to reassure investors that the region’s banks and governments are not about to fail.

The intent is to use the European Financial Stability Facility to insure the bonds of countries such as Spain and Italy, and to raise money from outside investors to funnel into bond purchases.

But the document gave no estimate of the value of the bonds that might be insured, of how much outside money might be raised or of how effective the strategy would be in increasing the size of the $600 billion bailout fund.

On its own, the fund is considered inadequate for backstopping the euro zone’s governments and financial system.

The impact of the insurance and outside investment scheme will become clear “after extensive dialogue with potential investors,” the document says.

With the euro zone under pressure from major nations such as the United States and China to take more forceful action on the debt crisis, analysts said it appeared unlikely that significant problems will be solved at Wednesday’s meeting.

“Even the most optimistic outcome, given the current scope of discussions, will not deliver a ‘big bang,’ ” said Sony Kapoor, managing director of Re-Define, a Brussels-based think tank.

“The time frames will be longer;

the numbers, if any, smaller;

and details less fleshed out than the markets would like.”

Along with a financing plan for Greece and new measures for the bailout fund, European officials plan to order banks to begin raising about $140 billion in additional capital to absorb losses on bonds issued by Greece and maybe other troubled European governments.

EU leaders approve banking bailout plan, while Greek talks continue

A MEETING OF the heads of the 27 European Union member state has ended with an agreement on a timeline by which European banks should be capitalised – as talks continue on other major stumbling blocks.

Talks on the debt crisis are reportedly stalled, further delaying the prospect of a comprehensive deal and sparking rumours that the EU leaders may have to meet again on Sunday – for an unprecedented third time in a week.

Reuters reported EU sources which said that talks on the volume of losses to be shouldered by Greek bondholders were likely to result in around €100bn being wiped off Greece’s national debt.

Bloomberg had earlier reported that the talks were stalled – with leaders divided on a draft agreement to enforce a haircut of 50 per cent on Greece’s private bondholders.

CNBC said it understood the deal had virtually been secured, though it reported comments from the Slovakian prime minister who said investors should be prepared to accept an even larger haircut.

Yesterday, Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker had said European leaders would debate haircuts of “between 50 per cent and 60 per cent”.

This evening a statement after the meeting of 27 European government leaders – which was painfully thin on details – did say leaders had agreed to complete a recapitalisation of struggling banks by next summer.

It was left to a meeting of the 17 Eurozone heads of state to continue more specific talks, while the group of finance ministers will be expected to continue the remainder of the talks at a later date.

Earlier today the hopes of a deal had been boosted after Germany’s parliament voted in favour of expanding Germany’s contributions to the bailout fund, which would have given it greater power to lend to struggling economies.

The need for an expanded EFSF has become more pressing since details emerged of a briefing document which stated how Greece was unlikely to be able to return to the money markets before 2021.

Banks to take Greek 'haircut' in EU debt deal

EU leaders agreed last night that international banks will write-off 50 percent of Greek debt, banks must raise more capital against losses and the Eurozone bailout fund is to get a boost.

"The Eurozone has adopted a credible and ambitious response to the debt crisis," French president Nicolas Sarkozy said after marathon talks Wednesday, on a new deal on combating crippling debt levels in many European nations.

“We have done what needed doing,” German chancellor Angela Merkel said.

The European single currency rose in value against the dollar last night on the news that the 27 nation bloc had come to agreement to bolster measures against the debt crisis.

The main bailout fund is to be boosted to one trillion euros and 100 billion euros of Greece's 350-billion-euro debt will be wrote off by banks – known by bankers as “taking a haircut”.

Banks are also to be forced to raise more capital against possible losses as Greece restructures its debt.

"The banks that participated in the stress tests will create an additional capital buffer that [...] should not be lower than 9 percent,” Poland's prime minister Donald Tusk said last night, referring to the European Banking Authorities tests on the financial strength of 90 of Europe's top lenders.

Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski added, however, that Poland's largest bank, PKO BP is not in the group that would be forced to pass the new anti-crisis strength tests.

“Even if it was, it's [capital] strength is greater than the 9 percent required in the tests,” he said.

“[PKO BP] does not require any capital injection.

Especially, it has only a residual commitment to debt securities in Eurozone countries," he added.

Last night Poland's president, Bronislaw Komorowski said that Poland still aims to adiopt the single currency, but only when conditions are favourable.

"It is a matter of choosing the moment.

Nobody in their right mind would suggest that this can be done today, or the day after tomorrow,” he said.

BRUSSELS—After 10 hours of talks, European leaders agreed Thursday morning on a long-awaited plan to reduce Greece’s debt burden and bolster continental banks in hopes of heading off a financial meltdown across the region.

The key to the deal was convincing private banks to take 50 per cent losses on their Greek bond holdings to give the country a chance to work its way out of its huge public debt.

European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said the agreement will reduce Greece’s debt to 120 per cent of its GDP (the measure of the country’s goods and services production) by 2020.

Under current conditions, it would have grown to 180 per cent.

Van Rompuy also said the eurozone and International Monetary Fund — which have both been propping the country up with loans since May of 2010 — will give the country another €100 billion ($140 billion Canadian).

That’s slightly less than amount agreed in July, presumably because the banks will now pick up more of the slack.

The news was initially welcomed on international financial markets.

“These are exceptional measures for exceptional times.

Europe must never find itself in this situation again,” European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said after the meetings.

The deal also calls for the eurozone to boost the firepower of its bailout fund to about €1 trillion ($1.4 trillion) to protect larger economies like Italy and Spain from the market turmoil that has already pushed three countries to need bailouts.

The leaders talked most of the night in an urgent effort to meet their self-imposed deadline for a comprehensive plan to ease the continent’s increasingly unmanageable debt problems.

A failure to reach agreement at the widely-watched conference could have had serious consequences for individual investors, banks and the economy around the globe.

And lack of full accord would for the first time have called into question the future of the euro as a 17-nation currency and the viability of the half-century-old European unity project that grew out of the ruins of the Second World War.

“If the euro fails, Europe fails,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said before the crucial session in Brussels.

The hours before the emergency summit saw dramatic developments across the continent as leaders tried to pave the way for more cooperation.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel won vital parliamentary approval at home on plans to increase the euro zone rescue fund’s firepower.

In another positive sign, Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi appeared likely to at least partially meet EU demands for new austerity measures designed to rein in Italy’s massive public debt, which is contributing to instability on the continent’s financial markets.

Berlusconi nailed down an overnight deal early Wednesday with his allies in parliament on emergency growth measures and pension reforms.

BRUSSELS—Investors reacted positively to Europe’s last-minute agreement on a continental bailout plan and Prime Minister Stephen Harper said it indicated “steps in the right direction.”

The hard-won deal to shore up European banks and ease Greece’s debt crunch was greeted with initial enthusiasm on international stock markets.

Speaking during a visit to Australia, Harper expressed “cautious optimism” that the European Union agreement would reassure money markets that Europe’s leaders were willing to take steps to rein in their spending and trim their debts.

“What we have been waiting for is something big enough in scale and decisive enough in terms of sacrifice that markets will be convinced the problem is being tackled and the pain is being accepted,” the prime minister said in a speech to the well-heeled luncheon crowd at a downtown Perth hotel.

“Only then will fears subside and confidence be restored.”

Harper has been urging European governments to tighten their belts and work aggressively to end the debt crisis and foster economic growth.

He commented after European leaders agreed Thursday morning on a long-awaited plan to bolster continental banks, help Greece and expand the EU’s bailout fund.

The key to the deal was convincing private banks to take 50 per cent losses on their Greek bond holdings to give the country a chance to work its way out of its huge public debt.

European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said the agreement will reduce Greece’s debt to 120 per cent of its GDP (the measure of the country’s goods and services production) by 2020.

Under current conditions, it would have grown to 180 per cent.

Van Rompuy also said the eurozone and International Monetary Fund — which have both been propping the country up with loans since May of 2010 — will give the country another $140 billion (Canadian).

That’s slightly less than the amount agreed in July, presumably because the banks will now pick up more of the slack.

China, which holds large amounts of bonds issued by European governments, welcomed the consensus reached at the EU summit.

In a telephone conversation with French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Thursday, Chinese President Hu Jintao said that he hopes Europe’s deal to tackle the debt crisis will help the region’s economic recovery, China’s state television reported.

“China hopes all these new measures will help stabilize the European financial market and conquer the current difficulties and promote the economic recovery and development,” Hu said.

European leaders had been under tremendous international pressure to agree on a blueprint for change.

“These are exceptional measures for exceptional times.

Europe must never find itself in this situation again,” European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said after the meetings.

The deal also calls for the eurozone to boost the firepower of its bailout fund to about $1.4 trillion to protect larger economies like Italy and Spain from the market turmoil that has already pushed three countries to need bailouts.

In an interesting development, the EU will look outside in hopes of enlisting China and other countries to provide funds to help backstop the bailout mechanism.

And the agreement will compel banks in Europe to raise their reserves by $148 billion by mid-2012.

The leaders talked for 10 hours in an urgent effort to meet their self-imposed deadline for a comprehensive plan to ease the continent’s increasingly unmanageable debt problems.

A failure to reach agreement at the widely-watched conference could have had serious consequences for individual investors, banks and the economy around the globe.

Greek Debt Reduced by Half Through EU Agreement

Posted by Caitlin Bronson on October 27, 2011 8:30 AM

share this story

The Eurozone is being overburdened and weakened by the Greek debt amid rate hike news, with another $65 billion reported... Read More ly required to keep Greece afloat.

=Half of the Greek debt has been forgiven after private investors agreed Thursday to accept losses of 50 percent on the country’s bonds, the Associated Press reported.

An official from the European Union announced the news that significantly cuts the load of Greece’s debt.

The agreement came at an emergency summit in Brussels wherein EU leaders had already agreed to force banks to raise the equivalent of $148 billion by June in order to contain the losses on Greek debt.

Leaders also agreed to raise the continent’s bailout fund to about $1.4 trillion in order to protect larger economies teetering on the brink of failure, such as Italy and Spain.

The deal involves a voluntary agreement by banks to take losses of 50 percent on Greek bonds, and should result in taking the country’s debt to just more than 120 percent of their economic output by 2020.

Currently, it stands at a staggering 180 percent.

The news agency reported that the breakthrough is considered a major success for the eurozone, though the effectiveness of the plan still remains to be seen in the final details that will be crafted in the coming days.

Still, leaders are hoping the deal was enough to boost market confidence, which has been waning since the debt crisis took hold of Europe during the summer.

It was the enormous problem of the Greek debt that weighed the eurozone down two years ago and began the downward spiral that resulted in its current debt crisis.

European leaders have been trying to deal with the repercussions ever since.

A cat's cradle of problems

Peace in Europe could be shattered if the euro collapses, the German leader Angela Merkel said today.

As EU leaders gathered for their second emergency summit in four days, she stunned diplomats by saying:

"No one should think that a further half century of peace and prosperity is assured.

If the euro fails, Europe will fail."

Economists warned that Britain will almost certainly be pitched into a second recession if the divided EU leaders fail to deliver a credible rescue deal.

David Cameron was hit by more Tory in-fighting over Europe, this time triggered by Mrs Merkel confirming that she will seek EU treaty changes to underpin a deal.

In the Commons Ed Miliband taunted the Prime Minister over Tory splits, saying he was spending more time dealing with his party than with the crisis.

Conservative Eurosceptics said the Prime Minister must use the summit in Brussels to negotiate a return of powers from the EU to Britain.

On top of the tensions, the sense of turmoil was fuelled by reports from Rome - quickly denied - that prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has agreed to step down because his coalition is cracking under the strain of austeritymeasures.

In the febrile atmosphere, Mrs Merkel's warning that peace itself could be endangered stunned politicians.

"What is good for Europe is good for Germany, half a century of peace and prosperity in Germany and Europe testify to that," she said in a speech to the German parliament.

"No one should think that a further half century of peace and prosperity is assured.

"It isn't.

And that's why I say if the euro fails, Europe will fail, and that mustn't happen."

A broad agreement on a three-pronged rescue package was hoped for tonight - but the critical details, which the markets were impatiently waiting for - may be left to yet another meeting of finance ministers to negotiate.

Mrs Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy are at loggerheads on how to fund a stability war chest.

"If they do not deliver a credible deal then a European recession looks virtually impossible to avoid - and that will make it very difficult for us to avoid a recession here in the UK," said Howard Archer, chief economist at Global Insight.

"The markets are getting ever closer to their tolerance level.

If the leaders fail to deliver something meaningful, they could really hit them hard."

Mr Cameron left with demands ringing in his ears from Tory MPs after Mrs Merkel confirmed she wants treaty changes and a financial transaction tax. Mark Pritchard, the secretary of the 1922 Committee, said:

"This provides opportunities for Britain to repatriate significant powers back from Europe."

A senior Tory warned said MPs would "strongly resist" any transaction tax that hit the City of London, potentially undermining its competitiveness in the world.

Some also said they will demand a referendum before any new treaty is signed.

Former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft said the Eurosceptic Right was in danger of costing Mr Cameron the next election.

"Monday's display [EU rebellion on a referendum] was damaging because it suggested to ordinary voters that the Conservatives are far away from them when it comes to priorities - the most important issues facing the country, and their families," he wrote.

Mr Cameron cancelled a trip to Japan to attend this afternoon's meeting even though he is only expected to stay for two hours.

After that the 17 eurozone leaders, led by Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy, were going into a private session.

"We hope to see some agreement from them by 10pm or 11pm," said an official.

"It might go into the early hours."

A provisional agreement is already in place on the recapitalisation of Europe's most exposed banks - none of which are owned by the UK - to the tune of about £87 billion.

That sum is not enough in the view of many financial experts, however.

But there is no agreement on plans to boost a stability fund to more than £1 trillion.

Germany has ruled out using borrowing by the central bank.

And Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy cannot agree how much money creditors to Greece will have to lose in a so-called "haircut" or "orderly default".

Former chancellor Norman Lamont warned of "great dangers" of the rescue plans going wrong.

"One of the dangers of the haircut that is being proposed is that a severe haircut will cause a credit event and will trigger credit default swaps and will therefore affect banks who hold those credit default swaps."

There was also concern that Britain could be saddled with a hefty bill if the International Monetary Fund gives more money to the eurozone.

Treasury officials said they would fight any IMF involvement.

One said:

'There should be adequate resources for the bailout fund but IMF loans  shouldn't be a substitute for action from the eurozone.'

In the Commons, the Labour leader taunted the Prime Minister, saying:

"Now he said on Monday that his priority is to repatriate powers from Europe.

Which powers, and when?"

Mr Cameron accused him of point scoring and said Labour would worsen the crisis by adding to the deficit.

Speaker John Bercow later reprimanded the Prime Minister for calling Mr Miliband a "complete mug" over Europe.

Mr Bercow said:

"I would prefer not to hear such terms used."

Key players:

Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel have had to steer a tricky course to settle negotiations

Britain's chances of recovery rise after this EU deal

James Ashton

27 Oct 2011

So D-Day to save the euro has come and gone.

Against the odds, Europe's dithering politicians delivered a package in the early hours of this morning that might actually have pulled it off.

It must make today the morning after the night before - and still Europe staggers on with a giant debt hangover.

But the difference is that now there is hope that after months of wrangling, leaders have finally got to grips with the issue.

What we wait to see is the detail behind the accord that will tackle the problem definitively.

Drawing a thick line under such a torturous set of negotiations was never going to be easy.

Bailing out Greece, preserving Europe's banks and preventing contagion from spreading to larger euro members such as Italy would be hard for one body to tackle, let alone 17 countries all with their own agendas.

At its centre, the relationship between Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel has been patchy.

Their tensions expose the flaw of the eurozone:

a 17-country bloc joined by common currency but not through common economic policy.

It was a club that nations clamoured to join, never considering they might one day need to leave.

The French and German leaders have been trying to pilot through unchartered territory with one eye on their angry voters in the rear-view mirror.

Whatever route the rescue plan took, it was always going to cost many billions of euros and thousands of jobs.

Average living standards could still plummet.

What is shocking is that failure to adhere to this plan will lead to something even worse.

If one country, such as Greece, were to be forced out of the eurozone, then the blueprint is there for further exits, paving the way for a slow disintegration.

On the basis of what emerged this morning, that should be avoided.

Some details are still sketchy, but there was significant progress.

Agreeing that Europe's banks need to pile an extra €100 billion on their balance sheets by next June is a concrete advance.

But how much is enough is all relative.

The International Monetary Fund said that Europe's banks needed to find an extra €200 billion.

For now, half as much is giving confidence levels a boost.

Then there is the haircut on Greek debt.

A reduction of close to 50 per cent has been on the cards for several weeks now. Banks, who were led to believe that government bonds were safe as houses, have finally bought into the plan after being offered extra sweeteners to do so.

The European Financial Stability Facility bailout fund (ESFS) will be enlarged to €1 trillion, but it is unclear how. Rather than tapping eurozone countries for more cash, ministers are relying on some financial hocus-pocus to increase its size fourfold through unspecified borrowing.

This is perfectly normal, Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, says.

Just leave it to us.

The Chinese could become involved, or Russia.

More cash from Britain, through its membership of the International Monetary Fund, looks less likely now.

Italy is another unknown quantity.

Fear over its debts could yet topple these plans.

If a fight breaks out in the Italian parliament when it is proposed to nudge up the retirement age, just think what could happen if Silvio Berlusconi is forced to draw up meaningful budget cuts.

But this is a time of concessions all round.

Merkel's credibility suffered a damaging blow yesterday.

Returning to the Bundestag to ask for approval to hugely expand the EFSF a few weeks after saying she wouldn't have to, it is no surprise that she was mauled by opposition politicians.

Yes, it seems Germany is the one that will be writing out all the big cheques.

The carthorse of Europe has few options to consider other than to grin and bear it. Remember, it has its eurozone membership to thank largely for its current prosperity, strong levels of exports and competitive edge.

Merkel needs only cast a glance south-west at Switzerland to see the damage a free-floating currency can have on competitiveness.

The stock market, at least, doesn't believe things are as bleak as they look.

After some wild gyrations in the summer, the FTSE 100 index is actually 12 per cent higher than its most recent trough at the start of the month.

And it bounced again this morning in relief.

An effective default by Greece has been all but priced in by battle-hardened traders.

It was just a question of when and how. And for the other nations, the fact that shares were largely unmoved over the past few days during the latest round of negotiations suggested there was belief the politicians would get there in the end.

No wonder the experts talk about buying time.

If the politicians can pin down a sensible route forward they can dampen fear that has not been far from the surface of this crisis and, slowly, but surely, deflate the credit balloon that has taken a decade to blow up.

That is only the beginning, however.

Until a European finance ministry is installed to oversee fiscal policy - perhaps by repurposing the European Central Bank - the eurozone still faces a shaky future.

That involves yet more concessions, particularly on the part of Germany.

And when it is put in place, what does that mean for the 10 countries, including Britain, which remain inside Europe but outside the common currency?

Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, might have been on to something when he warned last year that whoever won the UK election would be out of power for a generation, so severe would be the measures they would have to impose to get to grips with the debt crisis.

The same rhetoric applies in Europe.

David Cameron is so far holding his head well above the waterline.

In fact, this crisis makes Britain's decision to stay out of the euro look a masterstroke.

It might not feel like it, but with a separate currency and our own interest rates, we have that bit more wiggle room to chart a recovery.

Instead of being paralysed by the need for consensus, at least George Osborne retains the freedom to pull the levers required to drag us out of the mire.

And if that means turning his back on austerity at all costs, so be it. They are choices that many of his European counterparts look at enviously from across the English Channel.

(BERLIN)  Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated Wednesday that private investors like banks should take a writedown of at least 50 percent on their Greek debt holdings and told German lawmakers the world is waiting to see whether Europe can get a grip on its debt crisis.

Merkel spoke to the German parliament ahead of a vote on plans to increase the firepower of the eurozone's euro440 billion ($600 billion) rescue fund  part of a several-pronged strategy to calm the crisis and prevent it spreading yet further.

(See how much worse the euro crisis could get.)

She looked set to win wide parliamentary backing before traveling to Brussels for a high-stakes European Union summit there later Wednesday.

"The world is watching Europe and Germany;

it is watching whether we are ready and able, in the hour of Europe's most serious crisis since the end of World War II, to take responsibility," Merkel told lawmakers.

Europe has already bailed out three small eurozone members  Greece, Portugal and Ireland  but lives in great fear that it cannot bail out the troubled economies of Italy and Spain, the third and fourth largest economies in the 17-nation eurozone.

It also knows that the first bailout for Greece was not close to big enough to keep the country from defaulting.

With that in mind, European officials are working on several plans at once  resolving Greece's debt situation, strengthening the continent's banks, which are expected to take deeper losses on their Greek bonds than they had planned, making sure other eurozone nations don't need bailouts and boosting the EU bailout fund itself.

One key issue in Brussels will renegotiating a deal made in July under which Greece's private bondholders agreed to accept losses of 21 percent on their holdings of government debt.

That is now seen by EU governments as too little.

Merkel said the aim of Wednesday's European Union summit must be a solution that allows for Greece to cut its debt load to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020.

"That won't work without the private sector participating to a significantly higher extent" than was agreed in July, Merkel said.

She didn't spell out how much banks and other bondholders should contribute.

But according to Greece's international creditors, a cut of 50 percent on Greek bonds now would take the country's debt to just above 120 percent of GDP.

Greece's debts are set to spiral above an estimated 180 percent of economic output next year.

Merkel insisted that cutting Greece's debts, however that is done, won't in itself solve the country's problems.

"Painful and necessary structural reforms must be implemented," she said.

She added that a "permanent surveillance" of Greece would therefore be "desirable."

Athens' reform efforts have been monitored so far every three months by inspectors from the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.

Greece has so far opposed calls for a permanent surveillance mechanism in a bid to defend its sovereignty.

Merkel didn't mention Italy, where Premier Silvio Berlusconi averted an immediate government crisis by clinching an overnight deal on emergency growth measures demanded by the EU.

Berlusconi and coalition partner Umberto Bossi reached a compromise on raising Italy's pension age  a point of disagreement that had threatened Berlusconi's leadership.

While pressing the private sector on Greece, Merkel stressed the need for Europe at the same time to ensure that the crisis doesn't spread yet further, saying that recapitalizing troubled banks is "absolutely necessary."

"Anyone who wants private creditors to participate in debt sustainability must also ensure that a screening off, a protection against the danger of contagion is decided at the same time," Merkel told lawmakers.

"Anything else is simply irresponsible."

The EU summit will consider plans to boost the euro440 billion ($600 billion) bailout fund by offering government bond buyers insurance against possible losses and attracting capital from private investors and sovereign wealth funds.

The government decided to put that move to a vote in parliament, and thrashed out a joint resolution with two of the three opposition parties.

The risks Germany will shoulder are "justifiable," Merkel said.

"I'll even go a step further and say that it would not be justifiable and responsible not to take the risk," she added.

"I do not have a better alternative."

In her speech, Merkel stressed that the EU must be prepared to overhaul its treaties to overcome the crisis for good and ensure a better functioning of the eurozone's 17 nations and the EU's 27 members as a whole.

A future treaty must allow that eurozone countries not living up to their fiscal and budgetary responsibilities under the bloc's growth and stability pact be taken to the European Court of Justice, she said.

Wednesday's joint parliamentary resolution underlines the German parliament's expectations that, once the changes are implemented, the European Central Bank will no longer need to buy government bonds, as it has since last year.

It calls on the government to preserve the ECB's independence.

With the 17-nation eurozone's politicians struggling to agree on ways to calm the debt crisis, the ECB has been taking on the role of firefighter by buying the bonds of financially weakened governments on the open market.

That keeps the bond prices up and the interest rates down, allowing the countries to borrow on financial markets at lower rates than they otherwise could.

The German resolution also urges the government to ensure that there is a quick decision on European proposals to introduce a tax on financial transactions.

BERLIN (AP)  Chancellor Angela Merkel won the support of German lawmakers to increase the firepower of the eurozone's bailout fund Wednesday and indicated that private investors like banks should take losses of at least 50 percent on their Greek debt holdings.

The leader of Europe's biggest economy headed to a high-stakes summit in Brussels with a strong mandate to seal a deal on Europe's increasingly unmanageable debt crisis after winning a parliamentary vote 503-89, with four abstentions.

Yet uncertainty remained over whether European leaders would be able to nail down a comprehensive plan to solve the debt crisis.

"The world is watching Europe and Germany;

it is watching whether we are ready and able, in the hour of Europe's most serious crisis since the end of World War II, to take responsibility," Merkel told parliament before the vote.

"It would not be justifiable and responsible not to take the risk," she added.

"I do not have a better alternative."

Europe has already bailed out three small eurozone members  Greece, Portugal and Ireland  but fears it cannot bail out the troubled economies of Italy and Spain, the third and fourth largest economies in the 17-nation currency bloc.

It also knows that the first bailout for Greece was nowhere near big enough to keep the country from defaulting.

With that in mind, European officials are working on several plans at once  resolving Greece's debt situation, strengthening the continent's banks, which are expected to take deeper losses on their Greek bonds than they had planned, making sure other eurozone nations don't need bailouts and boosting the EU bailout fund itself.

"We have to take important decisions today," Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who also chairs the eurozone's finance minister meetings, said in Brussels.

"But probably we will not be able to get all the smallest details in."

European Commission spokesman Olivier Bailly said it was too early to say whether there would be clear figures for writedowns on Greek debt or on the future firepower of the eurozone bailout fund, whose lending capacity is now at $610 billion.

German opposition leaders briefed by Merkel say changes would take the fund's lending capacity above $1.4 trillion, but that has yet to be finalized.

Another open question was whether Italy will be able to convince its partners that it can get its economy back on track in return for help.

"Our Italian friends know exactly that we have to insist that tonight they tell us that we get important structural consolidation measures in Italy," Juncker said.

"That is a must."

French President Nicolas Sarkozy's spokeswoman Valerie Pecresse said the French leader commits "all his energy toward the success of this summit," aiming to forge a comprehensive solution to tackle the crisis.

One key issue in Brussels will be renegotiating a deal made in July under which Greece's private bondholders agreed to accept losses of 21 percent on their holdings of government debt.

That figure is now seen by EU governments as too little.

Merkel said the summit's aim must be a solution that allows Greece to cut its debt load to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020.

"That won't work without the private sector participating to a significantly higher extent" than was agreed in July, Merkel said.

She didn't spell out how much banks and other bondholders should contribute.

But according to Greece's international creditors, a cut of 50 percent on the face value of Greek bonds now would take the country's debt to just above 120 percent of GDP.

Slovakia's outgoing Prime Minister Iveta Radicova joined Merkel's call, saying as she left for Brussels that investors' "writedown has to be higher than 50 percent."

BRUSSELS -- The excruciating work of inking a deal to contain their two-year debt crisis over, European leaders turned Thursday to a potentially more difficult task:

implementing the agreement that asks banks to take on bigger losses on Greece's debts and hopes to boost the region's arsenal against market turmoil.

World stock markets surged Thursday on the news that the leaders had clinched a deal that everyone hopes will prevent the crisis from pushing Europe and much of the developed world back into recession and keep the currency union from unraveling.

But analysts were more cautious, noting that the deal remains vague and its success hangs on the details.

In the pre-dawn hours of Thursday, after the deal was unveiled, leaders claimed victory, but by evening, they were cautioning that their work has only begun.

"I think that yesterday we found a good overall package for the next stage, but I think that we still have many more stages to go," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Berlin.

Part of that work began Thursday when French President Nicolas Sarkozy called his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao and pledged to cooperate to revive global growth.

There was no word on whether Beijing might contribute to Europe's bailout fund.

Beijing has expressed sympathy for the 27-nation European Union , its biggest trading partner, but has yet to commit any cash.

The strategy unveiled after 10 hours of negotiations focused on three key points.

These included a significant reduction in Greece's debts, a shoring up of the continent's banks, partially so they could sustain deeper losses on Greek bonds, and a reinforcement of a European bailout fund so it can serve as a (euro) 1 trillion ($1.39 trillion) firewall to prevent larger economies like Italy and Spain from being dragged into the crisis.

After several missed opportunities, hashing out a plan was a success for the 17-nation eurozone, but the strategy's effectiveness will depend on the details, which will have to be finalized in the coming weeks.

The most difficult piece of the puzzle proved to be Greece, whose debts the leaders vowed to bring down to 120 percent of its GDP by 2020.

Under current conditions, they would have ballooned to 180 percent.

To achieve that massive reduction, private creditors like banks will be asked to accept 50 percent losses on the bonds they hold.

The Institute of International Finance , which has been negotiating on behalf of the banks, said it was committed to working out an agreement based on that "haircut," but the challenge now will be to ensure that all private bondholders fall in line.

The full program is expected to be finalized by early December and investors are supposed to swap their bonds in January, at which point Greece is likely to become the first euro country ever to be rated at default on its debt.

"We can claim that a new day has come for Greece, and not only for Greece but also for Europe," said Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou , whose country's troubles touched off the crisis two years ago. "A burden from the past has gone, so that we can start a new era of development."

Not all Greeks were convinced.

Prominent left-wing deputy Dimitris Papadimoulis said the agreement would doom Greeks to a deeper recession.

"The deal puts Greece in a eurozone quarantine," he said.

"We are now locked in a system of continuous austerity, haphazard privatization, and continuous supervision by our creditors."

Since May 2010, Greece has been surviving on rescue loans worth (euro) 110 billion ($150 billion) from the 17 countries that use the euro and the International Monetary Fund since it can't afford to borrow money directly from markets.

In July, those creditors agreed to extend another (euro) 109 billion -- but that plan was widely panned as insufficient.

Now, in addition to (euro) 30 billion in bond guarantees, the eurozone leaders and IMF said they will give Greece (euro) 100 billion ($139 billion) in new loans.

The last piece in the complicated plan was to increase the firepower of the continent's bailout fund to ensure that other countries with troubled economies don't get dragged into the crisis.

To that end, the (euro) 440 billion ($610 billion) European Financial Stability Facility will be used to insure part of the potential losses on the debt of wobbly eurozone countries like Italy and Spain, rendering its firepower equivalent to around (euro) 1 trillion ($1.39 trillion).

That should make those countries' bonds more attractive investments and thus lower borrowing costs for their governments.

In addition to acting as a direct insurer of bond issues, the EFSF insurance scheme is also supposed to entice big institutional investors to contribute to a special fund that could be used to buy government bonds but also to help states recapitalize weak banks.

Britain's FTSE climbed 2.9 percent to 5,712.

Germany's DAX jumped 4.9 percent to 6,311 and France's CAC-40 gained 5.5 percent to 3,344.

Shares in Asia posted solid gains earlier in the day.

Global markets welcome EU deal even as risks remain

04:47 AM Oct 28, 2011

LONDON - Global stock markets, the euro and oil soared yesterday after euro zone leaders struck a last-minute deal to provide debt relief to Greece, but analysts warned the plan would fail to halt the region's two-year-old crisis unless key details were resolved soon.

After a summit that ended at 4am yesterday in Brussels (10am Singapore time), euro zone governments announced an agreement under which private creditors would accept a 50-per-cent writedown on Greek debt.

Reached after hard-nosed negotiations between bankers, heads of state and the International Monetary Fund, the deal also targeted a recapitalisation of European banks and a leveraging of the bloc's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), to give it firepower of €1 trillion (S$1.76 trillion).

The euro rose 1.8 per cent, shooting above US$1.41 to reach its top level against the greenback in seven weeks following the deal.

The price of a barrel of crude oil rose 3.5 per cent to US$93.37.

European stocks surged to a 12-week high even as analysts at RBC Capital wrote in a note to investors that the summit was "long on intentions, short on details".

Late in Europe, London's FTSE rose 3.3 per cent, Germany's DAX jumped 5.4 per cent while Greece's Athex gained 4.9 per cent.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged about 2 per cent half an hour after the opening bell in New York.

Also helping sentiment was news that the United States economy grew at its fastest pace in a year in the third quarter as consumers and businesses stepped up spending.

The world's largest economy expanded at a 2.5-per-cent annual rate in the quarter, the Commerce Department said in its first estimate yesterday, a jump from the 1.3-per-cent pace in the April-June quarter.

Earlier in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.3 per cent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 3.3 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei rose 2 per cent.

Singapore's Straits Times Index added 2.8 per cent.

Under yesterday's deal, the private sector agreed to accept a nominal 50-per-cent cut in its bond investments to reduce Greece's debt burden by €100 billion, cutting its debts to 120 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020 from 160 per cent now.

In return, the euro zone will offer "credit enhancements" to the private sector totalling €30 billion with the aim of completing negotiations on the package by the end of the year, so that Greece would have a full, second financial aid programme in place before next year.

The value of that package would be €130 billion, up from €109 billion in the July deal.

Alongside the hit to the private sector, euro zone leaders agreed the banking sector would need recapitalising to the tune of around €106 billion.

Euro zone leaders also agreed to scale up the EFSF, the €440-billion bailout fund already used to provide help to Ireland, Portugal and Greece.

Around €250 billion remaining in the EFSF will be leveraged four to five times, producing a headline figure of around €1 trillion.

The EFSF will be leveraged in two ways, either by offering first-loss guarantees to purchasers of euro zone debt in the primary market or via a special purpose investment vehicle aimed at attracting funds from cash-rich nations like China.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke yesterday with Chinese President Hu Jintao to try to tap support from the country with the world's largest currency reserves.

Mr Hu hoped the euro zone measures will help to stabilise markets, China Central Television reported after the call.

Beijing has so far been a big buyer of bonds issued by the EFSF, which is rated triple-A.

EFSF head Klaus Regling is also due in Beijing today to meet Mr Yi Gang, the head of China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, to drum up support for the bailout fund.

"While the headlines look good, the devil is in the details ... There are some questions as to whether €1 trillion in itself is enough," said Credit Suisse strategist Damien Boey.

Agencies

â€¢ Significant reduction in Greece's debts.

â€¢ Shoring up the continent's banks, partly so they can sustain the deeper losses on Greek bonds.

â€¢ Reinforcement of a European bailout fund so it can serve as a euro1 trillion ($1.39 trillion) firewall to prevent larger economies like Italy and Spain from being dragged into the crisis.

World stock markets surged higher Thursday on the news.

Oil prices rose above $92 per barrel while the euro gained strongly â€” a signal investors were relieved at the outcome of the contentious negotiations.

In exchange for getting a break on its debt, Greece will come under much closer supervision than the past year, in which monitoring missions by EU inspectors have visited every three months to assess fiscal and monetary policy decisions.

Now, a team of advisers will be based in Greece, a condition Germany insisted on.

"I think that this is better than a Troika traveling back and forth there every three months," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after the meeting.

"It's a permanent system of supervision."

"We have reached an agreement, which I believe lets us give a credible and ambitious and overall response to the Greek crisis," French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters after the meeting ended early Thursday.

"Because of the complexity of the issues at stake, it took us a full night.

But the results will be a source of huge relief worldwide."

The deal with private creditors would significantly cut the debt problems of Greece, whose descent toward bankruptcy started the crisis that threatens to engulf the entire European Union .

"These are exceptional measures for exceptional times.

Europe must never find itself in this situation again," European Commission President JosÃ© Manuel Barroso said after the meetings.

Washington was closely watching the talks, which if unsuccessful could cause economic instability in the United States and elsewhere.

"We have made clear that we believe that the Europeans have the financial capacity to deal with this challenge and they need to meet that capacity with political will," White House press secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday.

After several missed opportunities, hashing out a plan was a success for the 17-nation eurozone, but the strategy's effectiveness will depend on the details, which will have to be finalized in the coming days.

The most difficult piece of the puzzle proved to be Greece, whose debts the leaders vowed to bring down to 120% of its GDP by 2020.

Under current conditions, they would have ballooned to 180%.

To achieve that massive reduction, private creditors like banks will be asked to accept 50% losses on the bonds they hold.

The Institute of International Finance , which has been negotiating on behalf of the banks, said it was committed to working out an agreement based on that "haircut.," The challenge now will be to ensure that all rivate bondholders fall in line.

It said the 50% cut equals a contribution of euro100 billion ($139 billion) to a second rescue for Greece, although the eurozone promised to spend some euro30 billion ($42 billion) on guaranteeing the remaining value of the new bonds.

The full program is expected to be final by early December and investors are supposed to swap their bonds in January, at which point Greece is likely to become the first euro country ever to be rated at default on its debt.

"We can claim that a new day has come for Greece, and not only for Greece but also for Europe," said Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, whose country's troubles touched off the crisis two years ago. "Let's hope the worst is over."

Since May 2010, Greece has been surviving on rescue loans worth euro110 billion ($150 billion) from the 17 countries that use the euro and the International Monetary Fund since it can't afford to borrow money directly from markets.

In July, those creditors agreed to extend another euro109 billion â€” but that plan was widely panned as insufficient.

Now, in addition to euro30 billion in bond guarantees, the eurozone leaders and IMF said they will give Greece euro100 billion ($139 billion) in new loans.

With the banks being asked to shoulder more of the burden, though, there were concerns they needed more money in their rainy-day funds to cushion their losses.

So European leaders have asked them to raise euro106 billion ($148 billion) by June.

The last piece in the complicated plan was to increase the firepower of the continent's bailout fund to ensure that other countries with troubled economies â€” like Italy and Spain â€” don't get dragged into the crisis.

The third- and fourth-largest economies of the eurozone are too large to be bailed out like the smaller euro nations Greece, Portugal and Ireland have already been.

To that end, the euro440 billion ($610 billion) European Financial Stability Facility will be used to insure part of the potential losses on the debt of wobbly eurozone countries like Italy and Spain, rendering its firepower equivalent to around euro1 trillion ($1.39 trillion).

That should make those countries' bonds more attractive investments and thus lower borrowing costs for their governments.

"These are exceptional measures for exceptional times.

Europe must never find itself in this situation again," European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said after the meetings.

In addition to acting as a direct insurer of bond issues, the EFSF insurance scheme is also supposed to entice big institutional investors to contribute to a special fund that could be used to buy government bonds but also to help states recapitalize weak banks.

Such outside help may be necessary for Italy and Spain, whose banks were facing some of the biggest capital shortfalls.

Using the insurance promise, the eurozone also hopes to attract big institutional investors from outside the eurozone, such as sovereign wealth funds, to contribute to a separate fund that would back up the EFSF.

Sarkozy was due to speak to Chinese President Hu Jintao later Thursday.

On Friday, the head of the EFSF, Klaus Regling, will travel to China, which has huge cash reserves, to detail the insurance plan.

So far, Beijing has promised to help only by continuing business as usual, trading with Europe and stockpiling some of China's multibillion-dollar trade surpluses in the safest European government bonds.

The eurozone financial crisis explained

"The world is watching to see if we are ready and able to take responsibility," she told the German parliament Wednesday before the vote.

"If the euro fails, Europe fails."

On Wednesday, the German parliament approved a de facto increase of the  $610 billion bailout fund, allowing it to be leveraged to bring it to over  $1.4 trillion.

This frees  Merkel's hand at a summit overnight  in Brussels to agree to a final deal, one put off at Sunday's summit after already being once delayed.

In the euro zone

Countries that use the euro currency:

Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain

Even so, European leaders also signaled there might be another delay of what was supposed to be, finally, a deal of all deals at the summit of all summits.

Analysts say they expect nothing different of the plodding EU leaders.

"You have 27 national sovereign governments â€¦ and all of them subject to domestic pressures,"  said Ben Tonra, professor of European politics at University College in Dublin.

"Getting consensus among 27 is always tough.

Plus you have the added nuance of there being the EU core of the eurozone and a growing division between that 17 and the other 10 countries."

The 27 European Union countries

Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom.

The package being negotiated is three-pronged:

increasing the European Financial Stability Fund, the so-called bailout fund;

providing billions to recapitalize dangerously leveraged banks;

and shaving the debt owed by Greece to bondholders to reach an agreement on a second bailout for Greece.

This, known as the haircut, could cut up to 50% of Greece's bank debt, if Merkel gets her way.

The details, constantly being renegotiated, are not yet clear.

But what is obviously on the table now is the open flirtation between eurozone leaders toward a deeper relationship to save their currency.

"European integration is profoundly in the interests of all member states and deeply connected to their future prosperity," European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said recently.

"For Europe to realize fully its future potential, it needs the right rules and the right institutions.

It requires a solid form of governance to ensure that the actions of individual countries are oriented towards the common good."

Still, some complain that is creating more cracks in the European Union, and causing anger and havoc in the process.

And it is leaving EU countries outside the eurozone with a conundrum:

What to do now. Some countries such as Poland want to make sure they are not excluded.

Others such as Britain are split, with some lawmakers calling for a way out.

On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron faced a showdown in the House of Commons over belonging to the European Union.

About 60 lawmakers in his Conservative Party bucked  party leads and signed a motion calling for a national referendum to decide whether Britain should remain in the EU. The motion was defeated.

Cameron said he didn't fundamentally disagree with the stance but because of the debt crisis, the "timing is wrong."

"When your neighbor's house is on fire, your first impulse should be to help them to put out the flames â€” not least to stop the flames reaching your own house," Cameron told the House of Commons.

"This is not the time to argue about walking away, not just for their sakes but for ours."

But he added:

"We disagree about ends, not about means.

I support your aims.

Like you, I want fundamental reform;

like you I want to refashion our membership of the EU so that it better serves our nation's interests.

The time for reform is coming."

In Poland, a country outside of the eurozone and the only major economy to escape the financial crisis, leaders are worried about exclusion.

They say they want closer fiscal coordination with the eurozone.

"The Poles aren't challenging the leadership of Merkozy (Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy), they are unhappy with the rules, the secrecy with which decisions are being made," said Kaczynski.

"Solutions have to include 27 not 17."

Still, some say those outside of the currency union should never agree to closer union.

"Non-member states would be suicidal to go in with the rescue packages being suggested," said Constantin Gurdgiev, professor of economics at Trinity College in Dublin.

"It would put the worst performing eurozone countries' risk onto the shoulders of non-member countries who are, relatively speaking, doing OK."

Others fear such a union dominated by Germany.

"We are the tiptoeing elephant," said Almut Moeller, EU analyst at the German Council on Foreign Relations.

"The German government over the last few months has not really managed to explain what they really want to do, so there's suspicion.

There's high expectations on one hand â€” the Germans have to sort it all out â€” and then at the same time, which is almost schizophrenic, there's a fear, and history plays a role."

Others say that the moving closer together is inevitable to avoid another situation where a member state such as Greece is on the verge of default and  Italy and Spain are teetering.

"We started with just a customs union, created a common market and then created a single currency," Tonra said.

"But when deeper integration comes, people will start asking where's the political leadership, where's the legitimacy?"

The eurozone financial crisis explained

Updated

Comments 8

A crisis that began with the discovery that Greece couldn't pay its debts has threatened to engulf not just the 17 nations that use the euro currency, but the entire 27-nation European Union .

Europe's strongest nations such as Germany and France have been the backbone of the bailout of  Ireland, Portugal and Greece, which used the euro's AAA credit rating to borrow and spend far beyond their means.

But as economic growth slowed, the need for more action has grown.

European banks that lent billions to financially struggling nations could face huge losses, which could in turn cause the crisis to spread to more stable nations and the United States . Demands that EU nations cut generous social benefits and spending programs to help pay their debts are unpopular with many citizens.

Voters have turned out governments in Ireland and Portugal.

Protestors in Greece say banks made bad loans and should bear the loss, not citizens.

Political movements in some countries say it may be time to pull out of the euro currency.

EU Leaders Reach Deal on Greece, but Worries Remain

Greece deal brings relief, but the euro zone has much left to do in stabilizing itself

October 27, 2011 RSS Feed Print

After a long night of negotiations, European Union leaders have brokered a deal to reduce Greece's debt and hopefully stem the continent's lingering debt crisis.

The deal is a major move forward, but it is still only one step in restoring stability on a continent beset by economic woes.

The 10 hours of talks resulted in EU leaders agreeing on a number of measures aimed at addressing the euro zone's broad problems.

The package targets cutting Greece's debt substantially, with private holders of Greek debt taking a voluntary 50 percent "haircut," receiving only half of what they are owed.

The agreement also greatly expands the European Financial Stability Facility, the euro zone's fund for bailing out troubled countries, from 440 billion to 1 trillion euros.

Banks are also expected to raise additional capital, both to cover losses on sovereign debt and show that they can survive future shocks.

[ Read about how the EU crisis affects the U.S. economy .]

"Because of the complexity of the issues at stake, it took us a full night.

But the results will be a source of huge relief worldwide," French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters early on Thursday, according to the Associated Press . Indeed, there was an almost audible sigh of relief in global markets.

European stock markets rallied , led by the banking sector.

Stateside, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shot up 250 points shortly after the opening bell.

The EU deal is a sign of substantial progress, but the larger European crisis is still far from over, says Benn Steil, senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.

"This is the 14th euro zone leader summit in the last 21 months, and there are going to be many, many more over the next 21 months.

So this is not the endgame by any stretch of the imagination," he said in a conference call on Thursday morning.

Broadening the scope from Greece to the entire euro zone is a reminder that it is not just the size of a state's debt but the size of its GDP that is important in this crisis.

Spain and Italy are the two prime examples of larger economies dealing with heavy sovereign debt.

"Obviously Spain and Italy are the main concern in all of this.

Obviously Greece is the biggest problem country at the moment, but in the scheme of the size of euro zone, it's miniscule," says Howard Archer, chief European and U.K. economist at IHS Global Insight.

"But obviously all along it's been the concern over Spain and Italy that has been the increasingly worrying feature for the euro zone.

And obviously a lot of these measures that were adapted last night were aimed very much at putting a firewall around Italy and Spain," he says.

[ Read about the president's new student loan proposals .]

With debt at 120 percent of GDP, Italy is a particular worry to the European economic community.

In an attempt to reassure EU leaders of his commitment to fixing Italy's debt problems, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi wrote a "letter of intent" to EU leaders outlining plans to boost his nation's growth and cut its debt, including sales of public assets, making it easier for employers to lay off workers, and raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2026.

However, considering Berlusconi's domestic political problems including numerous sex scandals, not to mention deep divisions over his retirement age proposal, some international watchers are skeptical of his commitment to reining in debt.

"If you're in Italian leadership, if you're a politician in Italy, you've got to respond to the realities of Italian politics," Sebastian Mallaby, director of the Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Thursday's call.

HIGHLIGHTS-EU and euro zone leaders comments on debt crisis

BRUSSELS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - European Union leaders met on Wednesday to discuss a comprehensive plan for tackling the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.

The meeting of leaders from the 27 EU member states was followed by a summit of the 17-nation single currency area.

Following are comments from leaders leaving after the full EU meeting, before the euro zone talks:

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON

"We made good progress tonight.

It is very much in Britain's interest that we sort out these problems and solve this crisis.

"We made good progress on the bank recapitalisation.

That wasn't watered down, it has now been agreed.

It will only go ahead when the other parts of a full package go ahead and further progress on that needs to happen tonight."

Following are comments from earlier, ahead of the EU leaders' meeting:

IRISH PRIME MINISTER ENDA KENNY

"I understand there has been some progress made in a number of areas, but clearly leaders of the euro zone will have their own individual points to put up here.

As I said, the important thing here that the fully flexibility of the facilities that were approved be used now to bring certainty, and certainty of intent, for everybody, from both the (European) Council and the euro zone in particular."

AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR WERNER FAYMANN

ON HAIRCUT FOR GREEK BONDHOLDERS:

"The wish is to come up with a voluntary haircut, I think that is right, but until that is negotiated we can't announce it. It's still open."

"We always said 40-50 percent is part of the negotiations but we have to be fair because we don't know what the counterparties would ask for that."

ON EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY (EFSF):

"The other issue is to improve the way the rescue fund is used.

To make it strong enough that it would last for a few months or years would be an elementary step forward.

If we always have to call summits against the background of a crisis it doesn't create a lot of trust.

"I'm very much in favour of making better use of the rescue fund and giving it more bearing capacity."

DUTCH PRIME MINISTER MARK RUTTE

"We need a real solution, we won't buy anything with mediocre compromises.

Some things really need to happen.

"We need today to talk about Greece and ensure that Greek debt is sustainable and that we're finally finished with this business.

We must talk about the banks and how they get through this difficult phase.

"We must ensure that this bazooka, the European rescue fund, is strong enough to show the market that we mean it. We also have to make sure this can't happen in the future.

We need strong supervision and live up to our promises."

"We are in this job to take decisions.

It's not easy, but it really has to happen."

BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER YVES LETERME

"I think we will have a solution for Greece.

It is very important to ask for a voluntary effort by the banks to reduce Greece's debt.

It is also an effort through the EFSF to make credit accessible at reasonable rates for Greece."

ON WORK AHEAD:

"I think it is work that advances step-by-step.

But the step we are going to take today or tonight is a very important step toward a total restoration of the confidence in the euro zone."

"It's an economic union in the making so it does not yet have the firepower it should have, but we're taking steps forward.

Let's hope for tonight."

ON EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY (EFSF) BAILOUT FUND:

"Let's hope we succeed in giving (the EFSF) enough convincing firepower.

It's one of the two to three most important points we still have to tackle."

"I think that in effect we would need to be a whole bit above 1,000 billion euros."

GREEK PRIME MINISTER GEORGE PAPANDREOU

"Our challenge today is not simply to save the euro.

It is to safeguard the ideas we cherish so much in Europe:

Peace and cooperation amongst our nations, social cohesion and solidarity without prejudice amongst our people.

"From our side the Greek people are making a superhuman effort to put our house in order, to make our economy confident, viable, prosperous and create a better future for the Greek people, for our country.

"Now is the time for the European leadership to collectively take decisions to end the uncertainty, end the crisis, turn the page and make sure we make a big step forward for the better future and prosperity and security of our peoples in Europe."

EUROGROUP PRESIDENT AND LUXEMBOURG'S PRIME MINISTER JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER

ON ITALY:

"Our Italian friends know well that we have to assume that we will be informed this evening that there will be significant, structural (budget) consolidation efforts from Italy.

That is a must."

ON AGREEING DECISIONS:

"I think that if we make our decisions in such a way that they work under pressure, then we will have made the right decisions."

BERLIN - German lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to give Angela Merkel a broad mandate Wednesday to boost the firepower of the eurozone bailout fund, just hours ahead of an emergency EU summit to tackle the debt crisis.

Chancellor Merkel won the backing of 503 members of the 620-strong Bundestag lower house of parliament, while 89 members voted against and four abstained, during a special session in which she said the euro's weaknesses must be resolved "now or... never".

Afterwards, Merkel was due in Brussels where hopes were dimming that European leaders will come up with the answers to the eurozone debt crisis at a summit crucial for the global economy.

Among the key issues is how to bolster the firepower of the 440-billion-euro ($612 billion) eurozone fund, amid fears it would be insufficient if Italy is dragged into the mire.

Germany categorically rejects any role for the European Central Bank in the eurozone bailout fund, or any increase in the 211 billion euros Germany is due to provide the fund in debt guarantees.

"The fundamental weaknesses and holes in the construction of the economic and monetary union must either be addressed now or, I say, never," Merkel told German MPs earlier.

"And if we address them now, then we will have seized the opportunity this crisis presents us. Otherwise we will have failed," she said.

BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's step-by-step approach is panning out in efforts to save the euro while at home she has blunted the opposition to emerge politically stronger, analysts said.

Although Merkel was earlier criticised for appearing slow to act and provide leadership in tackling Europe's debt crisis, the 57-year-old physicist earned plaudits for her style at this week's landmark EU summits.

In addition, Germany's first woman chancellor has strengthened her position domestically, analysts said, midway through her second term after a string of stinging setbacks for her coalition government.

"She now has a stronger position than before," Merkel's biographer Gerd Langguth of the Institute for Political Science and Sociology at Bonn University said.

Twice in the space of a month in high-stake parliamentary votes on the eurozone bailout fund, Merkel won enough support from her own centre-right coalition to not have to rely on the opposition's support.

"It's very important because the euro question is not very popular in Germany," Langguth said adding she had come away from the EU summit having achieved all her goals.

According to an opinion poll for ZDF public television, 51 percent of German voters asked said they believed Merkel had handled the euro crisis well, compared to 40 percent who disagreed.

Influential news weekly Der Spiegel commented in its online edition that Merkel had "reduced the role of the opposition parties in the euro rescue debate to that of extras", saying that future decisions should now be easier.

"Be it the Social Democrats or the Greens, they will merely rubber stamp whatever she hands to them," it said.

While in the past summit triumphs have often faded within days, Frank Engels, an analyst at Barclays Capital said that "market reaction in this case is already different".

"And if it actually stabilises, Merkel can already write that down as a success domestically," he said, as financial markets continued Friday to gain succour from the eurozone deal.

During the protracted negotiations on the debt crisis, much of the focus has been on the "Merkozy" chemistry of Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy and their roles in bringing Europe back from the brink.

Merkel, however, has effectively emerged as Europe's leader by default, Langguth said, highlighting that France and Italy faced their own problems at home, while Britain was outside the eurozone.

"At this moment, I am not saying that because I am German, but I think she is at this moment the leader within Europe," he said.

Hailing her as the "fairy godmother of Europe", the mass-circulation Bild newspaper commented Friday that Merkel had "finally taken over the command of the eurozone" at the emergency talks in Brussels.

Critics had accused Germany, as Europe's biggest economy and effective paymaster, of failing to grasp the reins in leading a way out of the European debt turbulence.

During the 2008 crisis Merkel even became known as "Madame Non" for appearing to dither over a stimulus package for Germany, but observers have now praised her "point-by-point" approach to negotiations.

"Merkel's apparent weaknesses have worked to her advantage in the crisis.

In contrast to others, she doesn't charge ahead like a bull in a china shop - she goes about her work in a cautious and considered manner," Spiegel said.

But looking beyond the euphoric reaction, the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung had a more sober take on the deal, which aims to avoid a Greek default and backstop other countries struggling with debt.

It said the crisis had got so bad there was no other alternative to the decisions finally taken by leaders which, it added, were "very expensive".

"Whoever believes the crisis is over its worst is massively mistaken."

European Leaders Struggle to Resolve Debt Crisis at Summit

Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker (L), France's President Nicolas Sarkozy (C) and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel (R) attend an European Union summit in Brussels, October 26, 2011.

European Union leaders are meeting in a crunch summit Wednesday to find a lasting solution to the spreading eurozone debt crisis.

The leaders got a boost earlier in the day when German lawmakers approved a proposal to strengthen the EU's bailout fund.

Analysts say that is one essential step in solving the crisis.

Heading into the talks in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged fellow heads of state to reach an accord.

Merkel said the EU leaders need to resolve a series of sticking points and work on moving forward.

One is a second bailout for debt-strapped Greece, whose financial woes helped trigger the larger eurozone problems.

Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said it is vital not only to save the euro currency but European ideals.

"Now is the time for the European leadership collectively to take decisions, to end the uncertainty and the crisis, turn the page and make sure we make a big step forward for the better future, prosperity and security of our peoples in Europe," he said.

With the risk of Europe's financial woes spreading overseas, the leaders are facing growing pressure for speedy and strong action.

German and French leaders have vowed to reach a sustainable solution before next week's summit of the Group of 20 leading economies summit in France.

European Leaders Agree on Debt Deal

France's President Nicolas Sarkozy holds a news conference at the end of a Euro zone summit in Brussels, October 27, 2011.

After overnight negotiations in Brussels, European Union leaders agreed on a deal forcing banks to accept 50 percent losses on Greek debt.

They also agreed to shore up European banks along with the European Union's bailout fund.

At a news conference early Thursday, EU President Herman Von Rompuy hailed the deal and spelled out some of its details.

"We fostered confidence in the European banking sector.

We approved a coordinated scheme to re-capitalize banks across Europe," he said.

"The ratio of the highest quality capital will be increased to nine percent.

This will enable banks to withstand shocks important in the current exceptional circumstances."

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the agreement offers a credible and ambitious response to the Greek debt crisis, which has spread to other countries in the 17-member eurozone.

Sarkozy says European leaders were determined to avoid the drama of a Greek default that might have the same disastrous consequences as the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse - which sent shock waves around the world.

Under the plan, banks must raise new capital to be able to handle possible sovereign debt defaults - and accept much bigger losses on such defaults than they bargained for.  

The deal comes amid strong criticism that EU leaders were moving too slowly and timidly to deal a crisis that now threatens to spread to larger European economies like Italy and Spain.

France's Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany - representing Europe's two largest economies - had vowed to come up with a comprehensive solution before next week's meeting of the Group of 20 major economies in the French resort town, Cannes.

World Markets Soar After EU Approves Debt Plan

World financial markets soared Thursday after the European Union approved a plan to cut Greece's debt in half and significantly increase a bailout fund designed to contain the eurozone debt crisis.

The Paris stock exchange jumped more than six percent, with the Frankfurt market advancing more than five percent.

The London exchange closed up nearly three percent, and U.S. indexes were all ahead by more than two percent in midday trading.

Reaction to agreement

AP

French President Nicolas Sarkozy arrives for an EU summit in Brussels on Oct. 26, 2011.

European leaders said the debt-relief agreement could help resolve the continent's two-year-long crisis and give Greece a chance to regain its economic footing.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said "we have done what needed doing."

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said it was a "credible and ambitious" plan, while Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said the result would be "a new era, a new chapter" for his country.

U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed the deal as a "critical foundation" to help solve the eurozone crisis and said the United States will support its European allies to address global economic problems.

What's included

Following 10 hours of tense negotiations in Brussels, EU leaders said they had convinced banks and investors to accept a 50 percent loss on Greek government bonds, effectively reducing Greek debt by $140 billion.

At the same time, the banks are required to raise an additional $148 billion by June.

The 17-nation bloc that uses the euro currency is increasing the firepower of its bailout fund to $1.4 trillion to cover future assistance for debt-ridden nations.

The deal still leaves Greece with a significant debt burden - estimated at 120 percent of its economic output in 2020, down from 160 percent now. But Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said that debt level "becomes viable" for the country.

The Euro

French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said the deal has effectively saved the European single currency, telling French radio that it will "stabilize the eurozone and global growth."  World Bank chief Robert Zoellick welcomed the deal, as did officials in China and Japan.

Financial analysts and world leaders outside Europe have said in the past that the continent's leaders were too timid in dealing with the crisis.

International creditors have approved single bailouts for Ireland and Portugal and two for Greece.

Those bailouts failed to calm the fears of financial markets that Greece would evenutally default on its obligations, and that the debt contagion would spread to bigger European economies in Italy and Spain.

Analysts said Thursday the Brussels agreement could give the continent's weaker economies more time to grow and adapt to the austerity measures their governments have imposed.

@oelergodt The reason behind a 'representative democracy' (a term which is a complete f*****g joke in itself), is that 51% of mainly uninterested, uneducated morons can 'legitimately' remove the rights of other 49%!

That's supposing there was a levelï»¿ political playing field to begin with (which there isn't), the elections weren't rigged with constant bombardments of propaganda from 24/7 'news' channels and a main stream media apparatus that Goebbels himself would have been proud of! : )

shanepaulcoward vor 21 Stunden

@oelergodt Public opinion 'on the street' as itï»¿ were suggests it is higher than that, and overwhelmingly against.That's why these snakes have taken away any chance of us having democratic representation by removing even the possibility of a referendum.When other referendums have been held in places like Ireland who also voted a resounding NO for example.The result is simply ignored and the 'electorate' is told to vote again.

This 'FU we are doing it anyway' attitude, has happened numerous times

shanepaulcoward vor 21 Stunden

UK must also adopt the Euro currency.

UK has been a member of the EU since 1973 or soï»¿ and the UK wants to take the profits but not the burden.

Oh I had no idea that voting was a thing of the past in the UK.

And as the most anti-EU country even the majority of Brits don't want withdrawal from the EU.

Although it is close - I'll give you that.

(49% as of Oct. 23)

There's aï»¿ reason behind the representative democracy.

And you do have Anti-EU politicians in the UK you can vote for. Just because you can't have it YOUR way every time doesn't mean voting is useless.

Hitler failed to occupy Europe for any length of time so now 'Fuhrer' Merkel isï»¿ trying again by trying to save the doomed Euro at any cost...the German people should stop her using THEIR money to save the mickey-mouse Euro.

@oelergodt LOL Voting wont make a difference?

Its not 'as simple as that' at all?

WTF? lol These crooks have intentionally taken away the right for us to vote.

They remove our democratic right of a referendum - it was as simple as that!

Polls show that the majority of the people in theï»¿ UK are opposed to our membership of the EU?

Half of Cameron's LibCON cabinet just revolted against membership.

The same in Ireland.

I expect Greek, Italian and Spanish polls would show similar stats.

Truth hurts

@KarujaSipelgas my voteï»¿ is to suffer now close euro de value suffer now for the good of the future people

2010butchd vor 1 Tag

@2010butchd I vote for suffering now. The stability fund makes room for austerity and reforms here and now. It calms the markets and lowersï»¿ interest rates for the troubled countries so they can reform with more space.

It should have started 2-3 years ago. Then we would not need a stability fund.

KarujaSipelgas vor 1 Tag

@KarujaSipelgas we all suffer now or we hide and make the next generations sufferï»¿

2010butchd vor 1 Tag

@2010butchd Well its a question of what evil is worse.

There are no perfect options that will make everyone happy.

Butï»¿ some options are way worse then others.

Price stability is more preferable then high inflation.

KarujaSipelgas vor 1 Tag

@KarujaSipelgas ahhh ok so the poor are not suffering now and the richï»¿ are not richer and my tax money isnt wasted on the eu who dont have their accounts checked serious the eu has to close

2010butchd vor 2 Tagen

@2010butchd Thats not true.

Greece will get nothing from the efsf, nor will Italy, but Ireland and Portugal will 100% get money from there.

After Greece takes a major haircut, banks willï»¿ aswell if they cant raise money.

If everyone in europe had their own money, then we would have a competitive money printing and that will cause inflation and shift the burden of the crisis to the consumer and hit hardest the poor.

That is not a solution.

KarujaSipelgas vor 2 Tagen

@KarujaSipelgas the money we give all the bail outs not a penny goes to the country in trouble it all goes to banks forï»¿ interest the country then owes even more the only way out is own money and de value meaning close this euro scam

2010butchd vor 2 Tagen

@2010butchd Idk, i like Ireland Greece Portugal Spain and Italy.

We should help them out. And if a new banking crisis is possible then we should help the banks too, because that would bringï»¿ the whole world economy to a standstill.

KarujaSipelgas vor 2 Tagen

Anybody knowï»¿ where can i see this meeting in full ?
