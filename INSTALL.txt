Installation
============

This is the installation document for the DIMA applied-textmining course offered
 in the winter semester (2011-2012) at the TU-Berlin.

Only Linux installations will be discussed. For simplicity Ubuntu 11-10 is used, 
but of course ever Student is free to choose which distribution he feels at 
home with. 

Ubuntu can be downloaded at http://www.ubuntu.com/download

If you are using Windows you can install Ubuntu in a Virtual Machine like
https://www.virtualbox.org/

Mac users will be able to do everything on the shell but commands will be 
different. Please feel free to send me what is needed so I can add it here.

Note: You need a working internet connection all the time (ping is your friend)

Setting up git
--------------

Git is a version control system (VCS). All the code that is written should be 
checked into git. If you want to do it the expert way then you will create a github 
account and fork our tree. If you have never used a VCS before I would advise 
just to use git clone and modify your code there and then send us a patch.
This will be described below. This course is not aimed at making you experts in
git, so KISS.

First we will need git. 

- Open a shell (Dash home -> "terminal")
- root yourself ($ sudo su)
- Set up git (# apt-get install git-all)
- Confirm with "Y" and see all the packages being installed. 
- Now we can test if git works (Ctr-Shift T will open a new shell)
	
	$ git clone https://github.com/dimalabs/applied-textmining
	
	This should start copying the applied-textmining folder into the current
	directory
	
Setting up Eclipse
------------------

Eclipse is probably the most used Java editor around. 

- Open your root shell again ($ whoami)
- # apt-get install eclipse eclipse-jdt
	will get you most of the stuff you will need. And it will take some time
	
- Try using eclipse for a minute or two, it needs some time to get used to

Setting up Maven
----------------

If you have programmed before you are sure to have used Make at some stage. For
this project we are going to use Maven.

- # apt-get install maven2

is all you need to do that

Setting up Maven with Eclipse
-----------------------------

If you want to use maven with eclipse we advise to install the maven eclipse
plugin called m2e. Which can be found under www.eclipse.org/m2e/
There is also a little introduction video which you can watch :)

- Start eclipse
- Help -> Install new Software
- In the Work With field: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases 
- Press Add
- Go to the Available Software sites and scroll to the right. Then be sure to
	enable every repository (If you get some dependency error you have forgotten
	to do this)
- Then select m2e - Maven integration for Eclipse and press Next
- You will be asked to restart eclipse after everything worked out ok

Under File -> New -> Project you should now see Maven

Fitting it all together
-----------------------

Now you have all the modules you will need to start programming

- Open a shell
- Go to the directory you want save your code in
	Tip: Use dropbox or ubuntu one so you don't loose anything
		# apt-get install nautilus-dropbox

- $ git clone https://github.com/dimalabs/applied-textmining
- Open eclipse
- File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project
- Select the Folder you cloned into
- This should then import everything


HowTo hand your code in
-----------------------
- Navigate to the folder with all your code
- Git add and commit everything
- Then create a patch
- $ git format-patch master --stdout > YOURNAME.patch
- Upload the resulting Patch to ISIS
- Don't forget to check that the file has some content and has everything you
	want to submit inside
